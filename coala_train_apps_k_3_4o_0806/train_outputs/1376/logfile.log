## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. There are `N+1` different colors, and Salmon wants to distribute these ducks into `N` boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and each box can contain ducks of at most two different colors. The task is to determine a valid way to distribute the ducks into the boxes according to these rules.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the box capacity `K`, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a list to keep track of the number of ducks remaining for each color.
   - For each box, try to fill it with ducks from at most two different colors.
   - Prioritize using colors with the most ducks to ensure that we can fill the boxes efficiently.
   - If a color has more ducks than can fit in a box, fill the box with as many as possible and move to the next box.
   - If a color has fewer ducks than needed to fill a box, use another color to fill the remaining space.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors used and the number of ducks of each color.

## Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = test_case
        boxes = []
        remaining_ducks = list of (color, count) pairs from duck_counts
        sort remaining_ducks by count descending
        
        for i from 0 to N-1:
            box = []
            fill_count = 0
            
            while fill_count < K:
                color, count = remaining_ducks[0]
                if count > 0:
                    take = min(count, K - fill_count)
                    box.append((color, take))
                    fill_count += take
                    remaining_ducks[0] = (color, count - take)
                
                if remaining_ducks[0][1] == 0:
                    remove first element from remaining_ducks
            
            if len(box) == 1:
                box.append((0, 0))  # Add a dummy color if only one color is used
            
            boxes.append(box)
        
        for box in boxes:
            output box as four integers: c1, m1, c2, m2

```

## Python Code

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K, duck_counts = test_case
        boxes = []
        remaining_ducks = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N+1)]
        remaining_ducks.sort(key=lambda x: -x[1])  # Sort by count descending
        
        for _ in range(N):
            box = []
            fill_count = 0
            
            while fill_count < K:
                color, count = remaining_ducks[0]
                if count > 0:
                    take = min(count, K - fill_count)
                    box.append((color, take))
                    fill_count += take
                    remaining_ducks[0] = (color, count - take)
                
                if remaining_ducks[0][1] == 0:
                    remaining_ducks.pop(0)
            
            if len(box) == 1:
                box.append((0, 0))  # Add a dummy color if only one color is used
            
            boxes.append(box)
        
        for box in boxes:
            if len(box) == 1:
                c1, m1 = box[0]
                c2, m2 = 0, 0
            else:
                (c1, m1), (c2, m2) = box
            results.append(f"{c1} {m1} {c2} {m2}")
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    K = int(data[index + 1])
    duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index + 2:index + 2 + N + 1]))
    test_cases.append((N, K, duck_counts))
    index += 2 + N + 1

# Get results
results = distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This code reads input, processes each test case to distribute ducks into boxes according to the rules, and outputs the result for each box. Each box is filled with ducks from at most two colors, ensuring that the constraints are met.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.

### Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts
        sort the list by count in descending order
        
        initialize an empty list for boxes
        
        while there are ducks to place:
            take the first color with the most ducks
            if its count is greater than or equal to K:
                place K ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color by K
            else:
                place all ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color to 0
                fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color
                reduce the count of the second color accordingly
            
            add the box configuration to the boxes list
        
        output the boxes list for the current test case

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.

### Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts
        sort the list by count in descending order
        
        initialize an empty list for boxes
        
        while there are ducks to place:
            take the first color with the most ducks
            if its count is greater than or equal to K:
                place K ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color by K
            else:
                place all ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color to 0
                fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color
                reduce the count of the second color accordingly
            
            add the box configuration to the boxes list
        
        output the boxes list for the current test case
```

    results = []

        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes while ensuring that each box contains at most two distinct colors. The logic for filling the boxes is flawed, particularly in how it handles the transition between colors and the filling of boxes when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - The current logic attempts to fill a box with the most available color first, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where a box needs to be filled with ducks from two different colors.
   - The logic for reducing the count of ducks after placing them in a box is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        while len(boxes) < N:
            # Take the first color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill with this color and the next
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m1 + m2 <= K:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))
            
            # Remove colors with zero ducks left
            color_counts = [(c, m) for c, m in color_counts if m > 0]
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    for result in results:
        for box in result:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    test_cases = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
        index += 2
        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1
        test_cases.append(((N, K), duck_counts))
    
    distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.
- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.
- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.

This revised solution should correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes according to the problem constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.

### Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts
        sort the list by count in descending order
        
        initialize an empty list for boxes
        
        while there are ducks to place:
            take the first color with the most ducks
            if its count is greater than or equal to K:
                place K ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color by K
            else:
                place all ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color to 0
                fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color
                reduce the count of the second color accordingly
            
            add the box configuration to the boxes list
        
        output the boxes list for the current test case

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes while ensuring that each box contains at most two distinct colors. The logic for filling the boxes is flawed, particularly in how it handles the transition between colors and the filling of boxes when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - The current logic attempts to fill a box with the most available color first, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where a box needs to be filled with ducks from two different colors.
   - The logic for reducing the count of ducks after placing them in a box is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        while len(boxes) < N:
            # Take the first color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill with this color and the next
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m1 + m2 <= K:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))
            
            # Remove colors with zero ducks left
            color_counts = [(c, m) for c, m in color_counts if m > 0]
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    for result in results:
        for box in result:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    test_cases = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
        index += 2
        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1
        test_cases.append(((N, K), duck_counts))
    
    distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.
- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.
- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.

This revised solution should correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes according to the problem constraints.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

        Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

        ### Problem Analysis

        The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. 

        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.

        ### Mistake in the Solution

        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` is incorrect for this problem. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not the sum of the first k natural numbers. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.

        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.

        ### Correct Approach

        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * k <= N. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        ### Revised Solution

        Let's implement the correct logic:

        ```python
        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for N in test_cases:
                count = 0
                # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
                k = 1
                while k * k <= N:
                    count += 1
                    k += 1
                results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.
        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is done using a simple loop.
        - **Output Results**: For each test case, we print the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        This solution correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for N in test_cases:
                count = 0
                # Find the largest k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N
                k = 1
                while k * (k + 1) // 2 <= N:
                    count += 1
                    k += 1
                results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.
        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This is done using a simple loop.
        - **Output Results**: For each test case, we print the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        This solution correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.
- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.
- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.

This revised solution should correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes according to the problem constraints.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.

### Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts
        sort the list by count in descending order
        
        initialize an empty list for boxes
        
        while there are ducks to place:
            take the first color with the most ducks
            if its count is greater than or equal to K:
                place K ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color by K
            else:
                place all ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color to 0
                fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color
                reduce the count of the second color accordingly
            
            add the box configuration to the boxes list
        
        output the boxes list for the current test case
```

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes while ensuring that each box contains at most two distinct colors. The logic for filling the boxes is flawed, particularly in how it handles the transition between colors and the filling of boxes when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - The current logic attempts to fill a box with the most available color first, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where a box needs to be filled with ducks from two different colors.
   - The logic for reducing the count of ducks after placing them in a box is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]

        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        while len(boxes) < N:
            # Take the first color with the most ducks

            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)

                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The current solution is not correctly distributing the ducks into boxes. The main issue lies in the logic for filling the boxes and updating the counts of ducks. Let's break down the problem and identify where the logic is failing:

1. **Box Filling Logic**: The solution attempts to fill each box with the most available color first. However, it doesn't correctly handle the transition to the next color when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

2. **Count Update**: The solution doesn't correctly update the counts of ducks after placing them in a box, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: Ensure that each box is described by two colors and the number of ducks from each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.

### Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts
        sort the list by count in descending order
        
        initialize an empty list for boxes
        
        while there are ducks to place:
            take the first color with the most ducks
            if its count is greater than or equal to K:
                place K ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color by K
            else:
                place all ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color to 0
                fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color
                reduce the count of the second color accordingly
            
            add the box configuration to the boxes list
        
        output the boxes list for the current test case
```

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes while ensuring that each box contains at most two distinct colors. The logic for filling the boxes is flawed, particularly in how it handles the transition between colors and the filling of boxes when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - The current logic attempts to fill a box with the most available color first, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where a box needs to be filled with ducks from two different colors.
   - The logic for reducing the count of ducks after placing them in a box is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        while len(boxes) < N:
            # Take the first color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)

                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))

            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        results.append(boxes)

- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.
- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.

This revised solution should correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes according to the problem constraints.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

    [Task]:
        The  Chef  has bought $N$ boxes of Tiles. The number of tiles present in  $i^{th}$ box is  $i$  ($i   $ varies from $1$ to $N$) . The Chef  has two houses  with  $N$  rooms  each, whose  floors  is a square with area $(i*i)$ ,i varies from $(1....N)$. He want to distribute equal number of tiles from $i^{th}$ box to any two rooms (each room must belong to one house ) such that all tiles  of $i^ { th}$  box is used and floor of  both rooms of different houses are tiled completely.
        Since chef is busy doing some other works so he wants your help to count the total number of rooms of both houses that will be tiled completely.
        Note $:$ size of  each tile present in boxes has length and breadth equal to $1$. It is not mandatory to use all the boxes.
        A room should be tilled completely from a single box.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains one integer $N$.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

        ### Problem Analysis

        The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. 

        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.

        ### Mistake in the Solution

        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` is incorrect for this problem. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not the sum of the first k natural numbers. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.

        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.

        ### Correct Approach

        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * k <= N. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        ### Revised Solution

        Let's implement the correct logic:

        ```python
        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for N in test_cases:
                count = 0
                # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
                k = 1
                while k * k <= N:
                    count += 1
                    k += 1
                results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.
        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is done using a simple loop.
        - **Output Results**: For each test case, we print the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        This solution correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's correct the solution based on the insights from the problem analysis. The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N`. This is because the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k * (k + 1) / 2`, and we need to find the largest `k` such that this sum is less than or equal to `N`. This `k` will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for N in test_cases:
                count = 0
                # Find the largest k such that k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N
                k = 1
                while k * (k + 1) // 2 <= N:
                    count += 1
                    k += 1
                results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.

### Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts
        sort the list by count in descending order
        
        initialize an empty list for boxes
        
        while there are ducks to place:
            take the first color with the most ducks
            if its count is greater than or equal to K:
                place K ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color by K
            else:
                place all ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color to 0
                fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color
                reduce the count of the second color accordingly
            
            add the box configuration to the boxes list
        
        output the boxes list for the current test case
```

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes while ensuring that each box contains at most two distinct colors. The logic for filling the boxes is flawed, particularly in how it handles the transition between colors and the filling of boxes when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - The current logic attempts to fill a box with the most available color first, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where a box needs to be filled with ducks from two different colors.
   - The logic for reducing the count of ducks after placing them in a box is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]

        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        while len(boxes) < N:
            # Take the first color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)

                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.
- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.
- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.

This revised solution should correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes according to the problem constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The current solution is not correctly distributing the ducks into boxes. The main issue lies in the logic for filling the boxes and updating the counts of ducks. Let's break down the problem and identify where the logic is failing:

1. **Box Filling Logic**: The solution attempts to fill each box with the most available color first. However, it doesn't correctly handle the transition to the next color when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

2. **Count Update**: The solution doesn't correctly update the counts of ducks after placing them in a box, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: Ensure that each box is described by two colors and the number of ducks from each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        for _ in range(N):
            # Initialize the box
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.

### Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts
        sort the list by count in descending order
        
        initialize an empty list for boxes
        
        while there are ducks to place:
            take the first color with the most ducks
            if its count is greater than or equal to K:
                place K ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color by K
            else:
                place all ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color to 0
                fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color
                reduce the count of the second color accordingly
            
            add the box configuration to the boxes list
        
        output the boxes list for the current test case
```

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes while ensuring that each box contains at most two distinct colors. The logic for filling the boxes is flawed, particularly in how it handles the transition between colors and the filling of boxes when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - The current logic attempts to fill a box with the most available color first, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where a box needs to be filled with ducks from two different colors.
   - The logic for reducing the count of ducks after placing them in a box is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []

        N, K = test_case[0]

        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        while len(boxes) < N:
            # Take the first color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)

                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))
                else:

            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    for result in results:
        for box in result:

   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        for _ in range(N):
            # Initialize the box
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill with this color and the next
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))
            
            # Remove colors with zero ducks left
            color_counts = [(c, m) for c, m in color_counts if m > 0]
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    for result in results:
        for box in result:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    test_cases = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
        index += 2
        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1
        test_cases.append(((N, K), duck_counts))
    
    distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.
- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.
- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.

This revised solution should correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes according to the problem constraints.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

        The  Chef  has bought $N$ boxes of Tiles. The number of tiles present in  $i^{th}$ box is  $i$  ($i   $ varies from $1$ to $N$) . The Chef  has two houses  with  $N$  rooms  each, whose  floors  is a square with area $(i*i)$ ,i varies from $(1....N)$. He want to distribute equal number of tiles from $i^{th}$ box to any two rooms (each room must belong to one house ) such that all tiles  of $i^ { th}$  box is used and floor of  both rooms of different houses are tiled completely.
        Since chef is busy doing some other works so he wants your help to count the total number of rooms of both houses that will be tiled completely.
        Note $:$ size of  each tile present in boxes has length and breadth equal to $1$. It is not mandatory to use all the boxes.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

        ### Problem Analysis

        The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. Each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. 

        To tile two rooms completely, the number of tiles needed is 2 * (i*i). We need to find how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.

        ### Mistake in the Solution

        1. **Misunderstanding the Condition**: The condition `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N` is incorrect for this problem. The number of tiles in the i-th box is i, not the sum of the first k natural numbers. The correct condition should be checking if the number of tiles in the box (i) can tile two rooms of size i*i, which is not possible because i cannot be equal to 2 * i * i for any positive integer i.

        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic should be to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. For a room of size i*i, we need i tiles, and we need to find if there are two such rooms that can be tiled using the tiles from the i-th box.

        ### Correct Approach

        The correct approach is to find the largest integer k such that k * k <= N. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        ### Revised Solution

        Let's implement the correct logic:

        ```python
        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for N in test_cases:
                count = 0
                # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
                k = 1
                while k * k <= N:
                    count += 1
                    k += 1
                results.append(count)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
            count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Iterate Over Test Cases**: For each test case, we determine how many rooms can be tiled completely.
        - **Calculate Maximum `k`**: We find the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is done using a simple loop.
        - **Output Results**: For each test case, we print the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        This solution correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's correct the solution based on the insights from the problem analysis. The task is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * (k + 1) / 2 <= N`. This is because the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is `k * (k + 1) / 2`, and we need to find the largest `k` such that this sum is less than or equal to `N`. This `k` will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

        Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
            results = []

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.
- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.
- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.

This revised solution should correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes according to the problem constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----

1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.

### Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts
        sort the list by count in descending order
        
        initialize an empty list for boxes
        
        while there are ducks to place:
            take the first color with the most ducks
            if its count is greater than or equal to K:
                place K ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color by K
            else:
                place all ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color to 0
                fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color
                reduce the count of the second color accordingly
            
            add the box configuration to the boxes list
        
        output the boxes list for the current test case
```

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes while ensuring that each box contains at most two distinct colors. The logic for filling the boxes is flawed, particularly in how it handles the transition between colors and the filling of boxes when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - The current logic attempts to fill a box with the most available color first, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where a box needs to be filled with ducks from two different colors.
   - The logic for reducing the count of ducks after placing them in a box is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        while len(boxes) < N:
            # Take the first color with the most ducks
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill with this color and the next
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                if m1 + m2 <= K:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                    color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                    color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))
                else:
                    boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))

        results.append(boxes)
    
    for result in results:
        for box in result:

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.
- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.
- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.
- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.
- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.

This revised solution should correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes according to the problem constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The current solution is not correctly distributing the ducks into boxes. The main issue lies in the logic for filling the boxes and updating the counts of ducks. Let's break down the problem and identify where the logic is failing:

1. **Box Filling Logic**: The solution attempts to fill each box with the most available color first. However, it doesn't correctly handle the transition to the next color when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

2. **Count Update**: The solution doesn't correctly update the counts of ducks after placing them in a box, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: Ensure that each box is described by two colors and the number of ducks from each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Duck Distribution Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem involves distributing a fixed number of ducks, each with a specific color, into boxes such that each box contains exactly `K` ducks and at most two distinct colors. The challenge is to ensure that the distribution is valid and adheres to the constraints provided.

#### Strategies and Challenges
Initially, the approach was to use a greedy algorithm to fill each box with the most abundant color first. If a single color couldn't fill a box, the next most abundant color was used to fill the remaining space. This strategy seemed logical but failed due to incorrect handling of the transition between colors and updating the counts of ducks after placing them in boxes.

#### Errors and Fixes
The main error was in the logic for filling the boxes and updating the counts. The solution didn't correctly handle cases where a box needed to be filled with ducks from two different colors. Additionally, the output format was not adhered to, as it required each box to be described by four integers, even if only one color was used.

To fix these issues, the solution needs to:
- Correctly manage the transition between colors when filling a box.
- Ensure that the count of ducks is updated accurately after each box is filled.
- Adhere to the output format by always providing four integers per box, with zero counts where necessary.

#### Conclusion
The problem highlights the importance of careful management of resources (ducks) and constraints (box capacity and color limits) in algorithm design. It also underscores the need for precise output formatting in competitive programming. Future attempts should focus on refining the logic for resource allocation and ensuring compliance with problem constraints and output requirements.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.

2. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.

### Pseudocode

```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts
        sort the list by count in descending order
        
        initialize an empty list for boxes
        
        while there are ducks to place:
            take the first color with the most ducks
            if its count is greater than or equal to K:
                place K ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color by K
            else:
                place all ducks of this color in a new box
                reduce the count of this color to 0
                fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color
                reduce the count of the second color accordingly
            
            add the box configuration to the boxes list
        
        output the boxes list for the current test case

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes while ensuring that each box contains at most two distinct colors. The logic for filling the boxes is flawed, particularly in how it handles the transition between colors and the filling of boxes when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - The current logic attempts to fill a box with the most available color first, but it doesn't correctly handle the case where a box needs to be filled with ducks from two different colors.
   - The logic for reducing the count of ducks after placing them in a box is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):

        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        while len(boxes) < N:
            # Take the first color with the most ducks

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's address the problem with a revised approach to ensure that each box is filled with at most two distinct colors and that the distribution of ducks is correct. Here's the corrected Python code:

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        for _ in range(N):
            # Initialize the box
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill with this color and the next
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))
            
            # Remove colors with zero ducks left
            color_counts = [(c, m) for c, m in color_counts if m > 0]
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    for result in results:
        for box in result:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    test_cases = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
        index += 2
        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1
        test_cases.append(((N, K), duck_counts))
    
    distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Color Sorting**: The colors are sorted by the number of ducks available, ensuring that we always try to fill boxes with the most abundant color first.
- **Box Filling**: Each box is filled with ducks from the most available color. If the box can't be filled completely with one color, the next most available color is used to fill the remaining space.
- **Count Update**: After filling a box, the count of ducks for each color is updated, and colors with zero ducks left are removed from consideration.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring that each box is described by four integers.

This revised solution should correctly handle the distribution of ducks into boxes according to the problem constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The current solution is not correctly distributing the ducks into boxes. The main issue lies in the logic for filling the boxes and updating the counts of ducks. Let's break down the problem and identify where the logic is failing:

1. **Box Filling Logic**: The solution attempts to fill each box with the most available color first. However, it doesn't correctly handle the transition to the next color when the first color doesn't completely fill a box.

2. **Count Update**: The solution doesn't correctly update the counts of ducks after placing them in a box, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Output Format**: The output format requires that each box is described by four integers: two colors and the number of ducks of each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Understanding the Output Format**: Ensure that each box is described by two colors and the number of ducks from each color. If a box contains ducks of only one color, the second color count should be zero.

2. **Logic for Filling Boxes**:
   - Iterate over the list of colors and their counts.
   - For each color, try to fill the boxes as much as possible.
   - If a color can't fill a box completely, use the next available color to fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the count of ducks is updated correctly after each box is filled.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
   - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
   - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

### Revised Solution

Let's revise the solution to correctly implement the logic for filling the boxes.

```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        N, K = test_case[0]
        duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
        # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending
        color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
        color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        boxes = []
        
        for _ in range(N):
            # Initialize the box
            c1, m1 = color_counts[0]
            if m1 >= K:
                # If we can fill a box with this color alone
                boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 - K)
            else:
                # Otherwise, fill with this color and the next
                c2, m2 = color_counts[1]
                boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, K - m1))
                color_counts[0] = (c1, 0)
                color_counts[1] = (c2, m2 - (K - m1))
            
            # Remove colors with zero ducks left
            color_counts = [(c, m) for c, m in color_counts if m > 0]
            color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        
        results.append(boxes)
    
    for result in results:
        for box in result:
            print(f"{box[0]} {box[1]} {box[2]} {box[3]}")

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1

    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
        index += 2
        duck_counts = list(map(int, data[index:index + N + 1]))
        index += N + 1
        test_cases.append(((N, K), duck_counts))
    
    distribute_ducks(T, test_cases)

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:

1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem requires distributing ducks into boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors. This constraint was not fully respected in my initial attempts, leading to incorrect outputs.

2. **Greedy Approach**: The official solution uses a greedy approach, which is effective for this problem. It prioritizes filling boxes with the most available color and then uses the next available color to fill any remaining space. This ensures that each box is filled optimally with respect to the constraints.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes specific handling for edge cases, such as when `n=2` and `k=5`. This highlights the importance of considering special cases that might not be immediately obvious but are crucial for passing all test cases.

4. **Efficient Use of Data Structures**: The use of dictionaries in the official solution to map original indices after sorting is a clever way to maintain the original color indices, which is necessary for correct output formatting.

5. **Iterative Box Filling**: The solution iteratively fills each box, updating the count of ducks for each color and moving to the next color when necessary. This iterative process ensures that all ducks are distributed correctly across the boxes.

In summary, the official solution provides a robust and efficient way to solve the problem by leveraging a greedy strategy, careful handling of edge cases, and efficient data management. These insights can be valuable for tackling similar problems in the future, where constraints and optimal distribution are key factors.
