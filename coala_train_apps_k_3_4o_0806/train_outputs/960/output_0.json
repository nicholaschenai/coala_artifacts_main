    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem requires generating a specific pattern based on an integer \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. For each test case, given an integer \\( K \\), we need to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern consists of \\( K \\) lines, where each line \\( i \\) (0-indexed) contains binary numbers starting from \\( 2^i \\) to \\( 2^{i+1} - 1 \\).\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Pattern**: \n   - For each test case with integer \\( K \\), we need to generate \\( K \\) lines.\n   - Each line \\( i \\) should contain binary representations of numbers starting from \\( 2^i \\) to \\( 2^{i+1} - 1 \\).\n\n2. **Pattern Construction**:\n   - For line \\( i \\):\n     - Calculate the starting number as \\( 2^i \\).\n     - Calculate the ending number as \\( 2^{i+1} - 1 \\).\n     - Convert each number in this range to its binary representation and print them.\n\n3. **Iterate for Each Test Case**:\n   - Read the number of test cases \\( T \\).\n   - For each test case, read \\( K \\) and generate the pattern as described.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    for each K in test_cases:\n        for i from 0 to K-1:\n            # Calculate the start and end of the range\n            start = 2^i\n            end = 2^(i+1) - 1\n            # Generate the line pattern\n            line = []\n            for num from start to end:\n                line.append(binary representation of num)\n            # Print the line as a string\n            print(\" \".join(line))\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\n    for K in test_cases:\n        for i in range(K):\n            start = 2**i\n            end = 2**(i + 1)\n            line = [bin(num)[2:] for num in range(start, end)]\n            print(\" \".join(line))\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the number of test cases \\( T \\) is extracted. Each test case value \\( K \\) is stored in a list `test_cases`.\n- **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, iterate from 0 to \\( K-1 \\) to generate each line of the pattern. For each line \\( i \\), calculate the range of numbers from \\( 2^i \\) to \\( 2^{i+1} - 1 \\), convert each number to its binary representation, and store it in a list.\n- **Output**: Each line is printed immediately after it is constructed. The `join` function is used to concatenate the binary strings with spaces in between.",
