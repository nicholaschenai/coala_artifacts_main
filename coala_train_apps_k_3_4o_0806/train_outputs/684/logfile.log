[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Congratulations !!! You have successfully completed the heist by looting all the gifts in Santa's locker. Now it's time to decide who gets to take all the gifts, you or the Grinch, there will be no splitting. So you and Grinch decide to play a game.
To start the game, an Integer N will be given. The game is played in turns and for each turn, the player can make any one of the following moves:
- Divide N by any of it's odd divisors greater than 1.
- Subtract 1 from N if N is greater than 1.
Divisor of a number includes the number itself.
The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.
Since you are the mastermind of the heist, you get to play the first move.

-----Input-----
The first line contains a single integer T (1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer â€” N (1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 109).

-----Output-----
For each test case, print " Me" if you win, and " Grinch" if otherwise (without quotes).

-----Sample Input-----
7

INFO - [Task id] 684 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

You and the Grinch are playing a game with a number \( N \). You take turns making moves. On your turn, you can either:
- Divide \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1.
- Subtract 1 from \( N \) if \( N \) is greater than 1.

The player who cannot make a move loses. You start first. Given multiple test cases, determine if you will win or lose for each initial \( N \).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Game Analysis**: 
   - If \( N = 1 \), you lose immediately because you can't make any move.
   - If \( N \) is even, you can always subtract 1 to make it odd, and then the Grinch will have to deal with an odd number.
   - If \( N \) is odd, you can either subtract 1 to make it even or divide by an odd divisor if possible.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If \( N = 1 \), you lose.
   - If \( N \) is even, you can always win by making it odd for the Grinch.
   - If \( N \) is odd, you can win if you can make it even for the Grinch by subtracting 1.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - You win if \( N \) is not 1.

## Pseudocode

```
function determine_winner(T, test_cases):
    for each N in test_cases:
        if N == 1:
            print "Grinch"
        else:
            print "Me"
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def determine_winner(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for N in test_cases:
        if N == 1:
            results.append("Grinch")
        else:
            results.append("Me")
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# T = 7
# test_cases = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12]
# determine_winner(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We define a function `determine_winner` that takes the number of test cases \( T \) and a list of test cases.
- For each test case \( N \):
  - If \( N \) is 1, append "Grinch" to the results because you cannot make a move.
  - Otherwise, append "Me" to the results because you can always make a move that leads to a win.
- Finally, print the results for each test case.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

    [Previous Critique]:
        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The current solution checks if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices. However, this approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that each element can be reduced by a multiple of its index, which means the sum of the sequence can be adjusted in a more flexible manner than just checking divisibility.

        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong

        1. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The solution assumed that the sum of the sequence needs to be divisible by the sum of indices, which is not a correct interpretation of the operations allowed. The operations allow for more flexibility in adjusting the sequence.

        2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic of checking divisibility does not correctly capture the ability to adjust each element by its index, which can lead to a variety of possible sums, not just those divisible by the sum of indices.

        ### Correct Approach

        1. **Cumulative Adjustment**: We need to consider the cumulative effect of adjusting each element by its index. This means we should simulate the process of adjusting the sequence to see if we can reach a sum of zero.

        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

        ### Revised Solution

        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:

        - Start with the sum of the sequence.
        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.
        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return "NO".
        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return "YES".

        ### Revised Pseudocode

        ```
        function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N = test_case[0]
                A = test_case[1]
        
                sum_A = sum(A)
                required_sum = 0
        
                for i from 1 to N:
                    required_sum += i
                    if sum_A < required_sum:
                        print "NO"
                        break
                    sum_A -= required_sum
        
                if sum_A == 0:

        ### Explanation of the Revised Code

        - **Iterative Adjustment**: The code iteratively checks if the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero by simulating the process of reducing each element by its index.
        - **Feasibility Check**: If at any point the sum of the sequence cannot be adjusted to meet the required sum, it returns "NO".
        - **Final Check**: If the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, it returns "YES".

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's correct the solution by properly simulating the process of adjusting the sequence to make it sum to zero. The key is to ensure that we can adjust each element by its index in a way that allows the total sum to reach zero.

        Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                N = test_case[0]
                A = test_case[1]
        
                sum_A = sum(A)
                required_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
                # We need to check if we can make the sum of A equal to zero
                # by reducing it by multiples of the sum of indices (1 to N)
                if sum_A % required_sum == 0:
                    # Calculate how many times we need to perform the operation
                    k = sum_A // required_sum

        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code

        - **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices (1 to N).
        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices. If not, it's impossible to make the sequence sum to zero.
        - **Operation Count**: If divisible, calculate how many times we need to perform the operation (`k`).
        - **Feasibility Check**: For each element, check if it can be adjusted by `k` operations without going negative. If any element cannot be adjusted properly, it's impossible to make the sequence sum to zero.
        - **Output**: Append "YES" or "NO" to the results based on the feasibility check and print the results.

    [Task]:
        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \le T \le 1,000$
        - $1 \le N \le 10$
        - $|A_i| \le 100$ for each valid $i$

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask #1 (10 points): $N = 1$
        Subtask #2 (30 points): $N \le 2$
        Subtask #3 (60 points): original constraints

        -----Example Input-----
        2
        1
        -1
        2
        1 2

        -----Example Output-----
        NO
        YES

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 2: We can perform two operations â€• subtract $1$ from $A_1$ and $2$ from $A_2$.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We have a sequence of integers, and we want to determine if it's possible to make the sum of the sequence equal to zero by performing a series of operations. In each operation, we can choose an index `i` and decrease the element at that index by `i`. We need to determine if it's possible to make the sequence "good" (i.e., sum to zero) for multiple test cases.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]` in the sequence, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

        2. **Key Insight**: The operation allows us to reduce the sum of the sequence by any multiple of the sum of indices. Therefore, the problem boils down to checking if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices.

        3. **Solution Strategy**:
           - Calculate the sum of the sequence.
           - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
           - Check if the sum of the sequence is a multiple of the sum of indices. If it is, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N = test_case[0]
                A = test_case[1]
        
                sum_A = sum(A)
                sum_indices = N * (N + 1) / 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
                if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
                    print "YES"
                else:
                    print "NO"
        ```

        ### Python Code

        ```python
        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                N = test_case[0]
                A = test_case[1]
        
                sum_A = sum(A)
                sum_indices = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers
        
                if sum_A % sum_indices == 0:
                    results.append("YES")
                else:
                    results.append("NO")
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            test_cases = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
                index += N
                test_cases.append((N, A))
    
            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **Input Handling**: The `main` function reads all input data at once and splits it into manageable parts. It then constructs the list of test cases.
        - **Sum Calculation**: For each test case, the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices are calculated.
        - **Divisibility Check**: The core logic checks if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices. If it is, the sequence can be made good; otherwise, it cannot.
        - **Output**: The results for each test case are collected and printed at the end.

INFO - [Task id] 684 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   You and the Grinch are playing a game with a number \( N \). You can either divide \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1 or subtract 1 from \( N \) if \( N \) is greater than 1. The player who cannot make a move loses. You start the game, and you need to determine if you can win given the initial number \( N \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The game can be analyzed by considering the possible moves and the resulting states. The key is to determine if a given number \( N \) is a winning or losing position. A position is winning if there exists a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. Conversely, a position is losing if every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position.

   - If \( N = 1 \), you cannot make any move, so it's a losing position.
   - If \( N > 1 \), you can subtract 1, which means you can always move to \( N-1 \). If \( N-1 \) is a losing position, then \( N \) is a winning position.
   - For odd divisors greater than 1, if dividing \( N \) by such a divisor results in a losing position, then \( N \) is a winning position.

   The strategy is to determine the nature (winning or losing) of each position starting from 1 up to \( N \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function determine_winner(T, test_cases):
       for each N in test_cases:
           if N == 1:
               print "Grinch"
           else:
               is_winning = False
               for each odd divisor d of N greater than 1:
                   if (N / d) is a losing position:
                       is_winning = True
                       break
               if not is_winning and (N - 1) is a losing position:
                   is_winning = True
               if is_winning:
                   print "Me"
               else:
                   print "Grinch"
   ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Congratulations !!! You have successfully completed the heist by looting all the gifts in Santa's locker. Now it's time to decide who gets to take all the gifts, you or the Grinch, there will be no splitting. So you and Grinch decide to play a game.
To start the game, an Integer N will be given. The game is played in turns and for each turn, the player can make any one of the following moves:
- Divide N by any of it's odd divisors greater than 1.
- Subtract 1 from N if N is greater than 1.
Divisor of a number includes the number itself.
The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.
Since you are the mastermind of the heist, you get to play the first move.

-----Input-----
The first line contains a single integer T (1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer â€” N (1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 109).

-----Output-----
For each test case, print " Me" if you win, and " Grinch" if otherwise (without quotes).

-----Sample Input-----
7
1
2
3
4
5
6
12

-----Sample Output-----
Grinch
Me
Me
Grinch
Me
Grinch
Me

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 684 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   You and the Grinch are playing a game with a number \( N \). You can either divide \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1 or subtract 1 from \( N \) if \( N \) is greater than 1. The player who cannot make a move loses. You start the game, and you need to determine if you can win given the initial number \( N \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The game can be analyzed by considering the possible moves and the resulting states. The key is to determine if a given number \( N \) is a winning or losing position. A position is winning if there exists a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. Conversely, a position is losing if every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position.

   - If \( N = 1 \), you cannot make any move, so it's a losing position.
   - If \( N > 1 \), you can subtract 1, which means you can always move to \( N-1 \). If \( N-1 \) is a losing position, then \( N \) is a winning position.
   - For odd divisors greater than 1, if dividing \( N \) by such a divisor results in a losing position, then \( N \) is a winning position.

   The strategy is to determine the nature (winning or losing) of each position starting from 1 up to \( N \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function determine_winner(T, test_cases):
       for each N in test_cases:
           if N == 1:
               print "Grinch"
           else:
               is_winning = False
               for each odd divisor d of N greater than 1:
                   if (N / d) is a losing position:
                       is_winning = True
                       break
               if not is_winning and (N - 1) is a losing position:
                   is_winning = True
               if is_winning:
                   print "Me"
               else:
                   print "Grinch"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_losing_position(n, memo):
    # Base case: if n is 1, it's a losing position
    if n == 1:
        return True
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    
    # Check if subtracting 1 leads to a losing position
    if is_losing_position(n - 1, memo):
        memo[n] = False
        return False
    
    # Check if dividing by any odd divisor greater than 1 leads to a losing position
    for d in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % d == 0:
            if is_losing_position(n // d, memo):
                memo[n] = False
                return False
    
    # If no move leads to a losing position, then n is a losing position
    memo[n] = True
    return True

def determine_winner(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for N in test_cases:
        # Use a memoization dictionary to store known losing positions
        memo = {}
        if is_losing_position(N, memo):
            results.append(" Grinch")
        else:
            results.append(" Me")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
    determine_winner(T, test_cases)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution uses memoization to efficiently determine if a position is losing or winning by storing previously computed results. The function `is_losing_position` checks if a given number \( N \) is a losing position by considering all possible moves. The main function reads input, processes each test case, and prints the result.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 684 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept revolves around determining winning and losing positions in a turn-based game with specific rules. The game involves either subtracting 1 from a number \( N \) or dividing \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. The challenge is to identify whether the starting position \( N \) is a winning or losing position when you make the first move.

The key strategy is to use dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently determine the nature of each position. A position is considered losing if every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, a position is winning if there exists at least one move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.

The solution involves:
1. Checking if subtracting 1 from \( N \) results in a losing position.
2. Iterating over odd divisors of \( N \) to see if dividing \( N \) by any of these results in a losing position.
3. Using a memoization dictionary to store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient even for larger values of \( N \), up to \( 10^9 \). The problem was a good exercise in applying game theory concepts and optimizing recursive solutions with memoization.

INFO - [Task id] 684 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game revolves around determining whether a given number \( N \) is a winning or losing position. The official solution leverages the properties of numbers, particularly focusing on odd divisors and powers of two, to make this determination efficiently.

2. **Efficient Use of Mathematical Properties:**
   - The official solution uses bitwise operations to quickly check if a number is odd or a power of two. This is a clever use of properties of binary numbers, where odd numbers have the least significant bit set to 1.
   - The solution also efficiently finds the largest odd divisor by iteratively dividing the number by 2 until it is no longer divisible, and then checking for odd divisors.

3. **Simplified Logic:**
   - The official solution simplifies the decision-making process by categorizing numbers into specific cases:
     - If \( N = 1 \), the Grinch wins because no moves are possible.
     - If \( N = 2 \) or \( N \) is odd, the player starting the game (you) wins because you can always make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.
     - For even numbers, the solution checks if the number is a power of two or if it can be reduced to a power of two by dividing by its largest odd divisor. This helps determine if the Grinch can force a win.

4. **Comparison with My Approach:**
   - My initial approach used a recursive strategy with memoization to determine winning and losing positions, which is more computationally intensive and less direct than the official solution.
   - The official solution is more efficient as it directly uses mathematical insights to determine the outcome without needing to explore all possible game states.

In summary, the official solution is insightful in its use of mathematical properties to simplify the problem, making it both time and space efficient. This approach highlights the importance of leveraging number theory and bitwise operations in algorithm design, especially in game theory problems.

    The first line contains a single integer T (1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100) â€” the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
    The only line of each test case contains a single integer â€” N (1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 109).

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print " Me" if you win, and " Grinch" if otherwise (without quotes).

    -----Sample Input-----
    7
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    12

    -----Sample Output-----
    Grinch
    Me
    Me
    Grinch
    Me
    Grinch
    Me
