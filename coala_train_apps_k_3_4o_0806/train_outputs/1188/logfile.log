## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a mafia organization with a hierarchical structure. Each member reports to exactly one other member, except for the Don, who reports to no one. We are given a list where each element indicates the person to whom a particular member reports. Our task is to identify all the "minor criminals," which are members that no one reports to. These members are potential killers. We need to output their indices in ascending order.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Don**: The Don is the only member who reports to no one, indicated by a 0 in the list.
2. **Track Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.
3. **Identify Minor Criminals**: A minor criminal is a member who is not in the set of reported members.
4. **Output**: Collect all such minor criminals and output their indices in ascending order.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the integer `N` (number of members).
2. Read the list `R` of size `N` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom member `i+1` reports.
3. Initialize an empty set `reported_to`.
4. Iterate over each `Ri` in `R`:
   - If `Ri` is not 0, add `Ri` to the `reported_to` set.
5. Initialize an empty list `minor_criminals`.
6. Iterate over indices from 1 to `N`:
   - If the index is not in `reported_to`, add it to `minor_criminals`.
7. Sort `minor_criminals`.
8. Print the sorted list of `minor_criminals`.

### Python Code

```python
def find_potential_killers():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    # Set to track members who are reported to
    reported_to = set()
    
    # Fill the set with members who are reported to
    for Ri in R:
        if Ri != 0:
            reported_to.add(Ri)
    
    # List to store potential killers (minor criminals)
    minor_criminals = []
    
    # Check each member if they are not reported to
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to:
            minor_criminals.append(i)
    
    # Sort the list of minor criminals
    minor_criminals.sort()
    
    # Print the result
    print(" ".join(map(str, minor_criminals)))

```

This code reads input, processes the reporting structure to identify members who are not reported to by anyone, and outputs their indices in ascending order.

        Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
        He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
        21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
        Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
        12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
        Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
        12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
        Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The problem with the current solution is likely related to how the input is being read and processed. The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads from standard input and processes the data is never executed. This is a common issue when dealing with standard input/output in competitive programming environments.

        ### Steps to Fix the Issue

        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` should be called to execute the logic.
        2. **Check Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly from standard input and processed as expected.
        3. **Output the Result**: Make sure the result is printed to standard output.

        ### Revised Solution

        To address these issues, we need to ensure that the function is called and that the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the revised solution:

        ```python
        def min_moves_to_sort_books():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            N = int(data[0])
            books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
            def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
                low, high = 0, len(lis)
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if lis[mid] < book:
                        low = mid + 1
                    else:
                        high = mid
                return low
    
            lis = []
            for book in books:
                pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
                if pos == len(lis):
                    lis.append(book)
                else:
                    lis[pos] = book
    
            min_moves = N - len(lis)
            print(min_moves)

        # Call the function to execute the solution
        min_moves_to_sort_books()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes

        - **Function Call**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings, which are then processed to extract the number of books and their current order.
        - **Output**: The result is printed directly to standard output, which is expected in competitive programming environments.

        These changes should ensure that the solution reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called and the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def min_moves_to_sort_books():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            N = int(data[0])
            books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
            def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
                low, high = 0, len(lis)
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if lis[mid] < book:
                        low = mid + 1
                    else:
                        high = mid
                return low
    
            lis = []
            for book in books:
                pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
                if pos == len(lis):
                    lis.append(book)
                else:
                    lis[pos] = book
    
            min_moves = N - len(lis)
            print(min_moves)

        # Call the function to execute the solution
        min_moves_to_sort_books()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - **Function Call**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
        - **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings, which are then processed to extract the number of books and their current order.
        - **Binary Search for LIS**: A helper function `binary_search_lis` is used to find the position where a book can be placed in the `lis` to maintain the increasing order.
        - **Building the LIS**: We iterate over each book and use the helper function to determine where it fits in the `lis`. If the position is at the end of `lis`, we append the book; otherwise, we replace the existing element at that position.
        - **Output**: The result, which is the minimum number of moves, is printed directly to standard output. 

        These changes ensure that the solution reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result.

        ### Problem Restatement

        Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are currently in a random order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books. A key observation is that the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books represents the largest subset of books that are already in the correct order. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This is because the books in the LIS do not need to be moved, and all other books need to be repositioned.

        ### Pseudocode

        1. Read the number of books, `N`, and the current order of books as a list, `books`.
        2. Initialize an empty list, `lis`, to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.
        3. For each book in `books`:
           - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.
           - If the position is equal to the length of `lis`, append the book to `lis`.
           - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.
        4. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
        5. The minimum number of moves required is `N - len(lis)`.
        6. Print the result.

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def min_moves_to_sort_books():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            N = int(data[0])
            books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
            def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
                low, high = 0, len(lis)
                while low < high:
                    mid = (low + high) // 2
                    if lis[mid] < book:
                        low = mid + 1
                    else:
                        high = mid
                return low
    
            lis = []
            for book in books:
                pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
                if pos == len(lis):
                    lis.append(book)
                else:
                    lis[pos] = book
    
            min_moves = N - len(lis)
            print(min_moves)

        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - We read the input and parse the number of books and their current order.
        - We define a helper function `binary_search_lis` to find the position where a book can be placed in the `lis` to maintain the increasing order.
        - We iterate over each book and use the helper function to determine where it fits in the `lis`.
        - If the position is at the end of `lis`, we append the book, otherwise, we replace the existing element at that position.
        - The length of `lis` gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
        - The minimum number of moves is calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.
        - Finally, we print the result.

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). The walls are represented as line segments from (a_i, 0) to (0, a_i) for each wall i. For each starting position (x_j, y_j) of Chef, we need to determine how many walls are between Chef and the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Input Parsing**: We will first read the number of test cases. For each test case, we will read the number of walls and their positions, followed by the number of queries and the starting positions for each query.

        2. **Wall Check**: For each query, check if the starting position (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall. A point (x, y) lies on the wall defined by a_i if x + y = a_i.

        3. **Counting Walls**: If the point is not on any wall, count how many walls are between the point and the origin. This can be done by counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.

        4. **Output**: For each query, output the number of walls Chef needs to break or -1 if the starting point is on a wall.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function process_test_cases():
            read T  # number of test cases
            for each test case:
                read N  # number of walls
                read a  # list of N integers representing wall positions
                read Q  # number of queries
                for each query:
                    read x, y  # starting position of Chef
                    if x + y is in a:
                        print -1
                    else:
                        count = number of elements in a greater than x + y
                        print count
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def process_test_cases():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0

                N = int(data[index])
                index += 1
                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
                index += N
                Q = int(data[index])
                index += 1

                    y = int(data[index + 1])
                    index += 2
            
                    sum_xy = x + y
                    if sum_xy in a_set:
                        results.append(-1)
                    else:
                        # Count how many a_i are greater than sum_xy
                        count = 0
                        for ai in a:

            for result in results:
                print(result)

        process_test_cases()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Set for Fast Lookup**: We use a set to quickly check if a point lies on a wall.
        - **Counting Walls**: We iterate over the list of wall positions to count how many are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using set operations and simple iteration, ensuring it can process up to the maximum input sizes specified.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia is structured hierarchically with a single Don at the top. Each member reports to exactly one other member, except the Don who reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a minor criminal, i.e., a member who nobody reports to. Given the reporting structure, we need to find all such members.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of members, `N`, and the list of integers `R` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom the `i-th` member reports.

2. **Identify Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.

3. **Determine Potential Killers**: Iterate through the list of members. A member is a potential killer if they are not in the set of reported members.

4. **Output**: Collect all potential killers and print them in ascending order.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_potential_killers():
    read N  # number of members
    read R  # list of reporting relationships

    reported_to_set = set()  # to track members who are reported to

    for each member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            add member to reported_to_set

    potential_killers = []
    for i from 1 to N:
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            add i to potential_killers

    sort potential_killers
    print potential_killers as space-separated integers
```

### Explanation

- **Set Usage**: We use a set to efficiently track which members are reported to, as set lookups are average O(1) in time complexity.
- **Iterate and Check**: We iterate over each member from 1 to N and check if they are in the set of reported members. If not, they are added to the list of potential killers.
- **Sorting**: Finally, we sort the list of potential killers to ensure the output is in ascending order, as required by the problem statement.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----

We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia is structured hierarchically with a single Don at the top. Each member reports to exactly one other member, except the Don who reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a minor criminal, i.e., a member who nobody reports to. Given the reporting structure, we need to find all such members.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of members, `N`, and the list of integers `R` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom the `i-th` member reports.

2. **Identify Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.

3. **Determine Potential Killers**: Iterate through the list of members. A member is a potential killer if they are not in the set of reported members.

4. **Output**: Collect all potential killers and print them in ascending order.

function find_potential_killers():
    read N  # number of members
    read R  # list of reporting relationships

    reported_to_set = set()  # to track members who are reported to

    for each member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            add member to reported_to_set

    potential_killers = []
    for i from 1 to N:
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            add i to potential_killers

    sort potential_killers
    print potential_killers as space-separated integers
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_potential_killers():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    reported_to_set = set()
    
    # Collect all members who are reported to
    for member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            reported_to_set.add(member)
    
    potential_killers = []
    
    # Find members who are not reported to by anyone
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers
    potential_killers.sort()
    
    # Print the result
    print(" ".join(map(str, potential_killers)))

```

### Explanation

- **Set Usage**: We use a set to efficiently track which members are reported to, as set lookups are average O(1) in time complexity.
- **Iterate and Check**: We iterate over each member from 1 to N and check if they are in the set of reported members. If not, they are added to the list of potential killers.
- **Sorting**: Finally, we sort the list of potential killers to ensure the output is in ascending order, as required by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the function `find_potential_killers()` is defined but never called. In a competitive programming environment or when reading from standard input, the function needs to be executed to process the input and produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Function Execution**: Ensure that the function `find_potential_killers()` is called after its definition so that it processes the input and produces the output.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, which is correct, but we need to ensure that the function is executed in the environment where the input is provided.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the output is correctly formatted and printed.

### Corrected Solution

```python
def find_potential_killers():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    reported_to_set = set()
    
    # Collect all members who are reported to
    for member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            reported_to_set.add(member)
    
    potential_killers = []
    
    # Find members who are not reported to by anyone
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers
    potential_killers.sort()
    
    # Print the result
    print(" ".join(map(str, potential_killers)))

# Call the function to execute the solution
find_potential_killers()
```

### Explanation of the Correction

- **Function Call**: By adding the call to `find_potential_killers()` at the end of the script, we ensure that the function is executed when the script runs. This allows the input to be processed and the output to be generated as expected.
- **Standard Input/Output**: The function reads from standard input and writes to standard output, which is typical in competitive programming and aligns with the problem requirements.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia is structured hierarchically with a single Don at the top. Each member reports to exactly one other member, except the Don who reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a minor criminal, i.e., a member who nobody reports to. Given the reporting structure, we need to find all such members.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of members, `N`, and the list of integers `R` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom the `i-th` member reports.

2. **Identify Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.

3. **Determine Potential Killers**: Iterate through the list of members. A member is a potential killer if they are not in the set of reported members.

4. **Output**: Collect all potential killers and print them in ascending order.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_potential_killers():
    read N  # number of members
    read R  # list of reporting relationships

    reported_to_set = set()  # to track members who are reported to

    for each member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            add member to reported_to_set

    potential_killers = []
    for i from 1 to N:
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            add i to potential_killers

    sort potential_killers
    print potential_killers as space-separated integers
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_potential_killers():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    reported_to_set = set()
    
    # Collect all members who are reported to
    for member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            reported_to_set.add(member)
    
    potential_killers = []
    
    # Find members who are not reported to by anyone
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers
    potential_killers.sort()

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Analysis of the Current Solution
        1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input and `sys.stdout.write` to output results. This is appropriate for competitive programming but can be tricky if not handled correctly. The function `find_permutation` is defined but not called, which means the code doesn't execute.

        2. **Logic for Permutation Construction**:
           - The logic attempts to start with the maximum possible sum by using a descending order permutation.
           - It then tries to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K by swapping adjacent elements.

        3. **Mistakes and Misunderstandings**:
           - The function `find_permutation` is defined but never called, so no logic is executed.
           - The permutation adjustment logic might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the sum needs to be reduced by more than one at a time.
           - The permutation construction logic might not correctly handle cases where the desired sum K is exactly the maximum possible sum.

        ### Steps to Correct the Solution
        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: Make sure the function is executed by calling it after its definition.
        2. **Refine the Permutation Adjustment Logic**:
           - Ensure that the logic correctly reduces the sum to K by considering larger swaps or more efficient adjustments.
           - Handle edge cases where the desired sum is exactly the maximum possible sum.

        3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure correctness.

        ### Revised Solution
        Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

        ```python
        def find_permutation():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read

            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)
                min_possible = N - 1
                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    # Start with the permutation in descending order
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = max_possible
            
                    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
                    for i in range(N - 1):
                        if current_sum == K:
                            break

                        current_max = max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1])

                        new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)
                        # Calculate the difference
                        diff = current_max - new_max
                        # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap
                        if current_sum - diff >= K:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_sum -= diff
            
                    results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        # Call the function to execute
        find_permutation()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes
        - **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.
        - **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.
        - **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.

        Let's fix the solution by ensuring the function is called and the logic is correctly implemented to handle the permutation construction and adjustment. Here's the corrected code:

            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2

                max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        
                if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    # Start with the permutation in descending order
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))

                        # Calculate the difference
                        diff = current_max - new_max
                        # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap
                        if current_sum - diff >= K:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to generate a specific pattern based on an integer \( K \) for multiple test cases. The pattern required was a sequence of lines where each line \( i \) (0-indexed) contains the string "10" repeated \( i+1 \) times. The challenge was to correctly interpret the pattern and implement it efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding that the pattern alternates between "1" and "0" starting with "1" for each line.
    - **Iterative Construction**: Using loops to construct each line of the pattern based on the current index.

    ### Strategies:
    - Initially, I misunderstood the pattern as a numeric sequence, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct approach was to focus on alternating characters.
    - The solution involved iterating over each test case and constructing each line by alternating "1" and "0" for the required number of times.

    ### Lessons Learned:
    - **Pattern Construction**: When dealing with pattern problems, it's crucial to carefully analyze the example outputs to understand the underlying logic.
    - **Iterative Logic**: Using loops effectively to build strings based on index values can simplify the problem-solving process.
    - **Debugging**: When the output doesn't match expectations, revisiting the problem statement and examples can help realign the solution approach.

    ### Final Solution:
    The final solution involved reading input values, iterating over each test case, and generating the required pattern by alternating "1" and "0" for each line. This approach successfully passed all test cases.

    ```python
    def generate_pattern():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        # Read each test case value
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        # For each test case
        for K in test_cases:
            # Generate K lines
            for i in range(K):
                # Start with "1" and alternate between "0" and "1"
                line = ''.join('1' if j % 2 == 0 else '0' for j in range(i + 1))
                # Print the line
                print(line)

    # Call the function to execute the pattern generation
    generate_pattern()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem requirements and iteratively refining the solution to meet those requirements.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia is structured hierarchically with a single Don at the top. Each member reports to exactly one other member, except the Don who reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a minor criminal, i.e., a member who nobody reports to. Given the reporting structure, we need to find all such members.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of members, `N`, and the list of integers `R` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom the `i-th` member reports.

2. **Identify Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.

3. **Determine Potential Killers**: Iterate through the list of members. A member is a potential killer if they are not in the set of reported members.

4. **Output**: Collect all potential killers and print them in ascending order.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_potential_killers():
    read N  # number of members
    read R  # list of reporting relationships

    reported_to_set = set()  # to track members who are reported to

    for each member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            add member to reported_to_set

    potential_killers = []
    for i from 1 to N:
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            add i to potential_killers

    sort potential_killers
    print potential_killers as space-separated integers
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_potential_killers():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    reported_to_set = set()
    
    # Collect all members who are reported to
    for member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            reported_to_set.add(member)
    
    potential_killers = []
    
    # Find members who are not reported to by anyone
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers
    potential_killers.sort()
    
    # Print the result
    print(" ".join(map(str, potential_killers)))

```

### Explanation

- **Set Usage**: We use a set to efficiently track which members are reported to, as set lookups are average O(1) in time complexity.
- **Iterate and Check**: We iterate over each member from 1 to N and check if they are in the set of reported members. If not, they are added to the list of potential killers.
- **Sorting**: Finally, we sort the list of potential killers to ensure the output is in ascending order, as required by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the function `find_potential_killers()` is defined but never called. In a competitive programming environment or when reading from standard input, the function needs to be executed to process the input and produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Function Execution**: Ensure that the function `find_potential_killers()` is called after its definition so that it processes the input and produces the output.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, which is correct, but we need to ensure that the function is executed in the environment where the input is provided.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the output is correctly formatted and printed.

### Explanation of the Correction

- **Function Call**: By adding the call to `find_potential_killers()` at the end of the script, we ensure that the function is executed when the script runs. This allows the input to be processed and the output to be generated as expected.
- **Standard Input/Output**: The function reads from standard input and writes to standard output, which is typical in competitive programming and aligns with the problem requirements.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] In this problem, the task was to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a hierarchical reporting structure. The key concept was to find members who are not reported to by anyone else, as these are considered minor criminals or potential killers.

### Core Concepts and Patterns
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Understanding the reporting hierarchy and identifying members who are not reported to by others.
- **Set Usage**: Efficiently tracking members who are reported to using a set, which allows for quick lookups.

### Strategies and Fixes
- **Initial Mistake**: The initial solution defined the function but did not call it, leading to no output. This was a simple oversight but crucial in ensuring the function executes.
- **Input/Output Handling**: The solution correctly used standard input and output, which is typical in competitive programming environments.

### Final Solution
The final solution involved reading the input, identifying members who are reported to, and then determining which members are not in this set. These members were collected, sorted, and printed as the potential killers. The function was called at the end to ensure execution.

This problem reinforced the importance of function execution in script-based environments and the utility of sets for efficient membership testing.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia is structured hierarchically with a single Don at the top. Each member reports to exactly one other member, except the Don who reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a minor criminal, i.e., a member who nobody reports to. Given the reporting structure, we need to find all such members.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of members, `N`, and the list of integers `R` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom the `i-th` member reports.

2. **Identify Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.

3. **Determine Potential Killers**: Iterate through the list of members. A member is a potential killer if they are not in the set of reported members.

4. **Output**: Collect all potential killers and print them in ascending order.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_potential_killers():
    read N  # number of members
    read R  # list of reporting relationships

    reported_to_set = set()  # to track members who are reported to

    for each member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            add member to reported_to_set

    potential_killers = []
    for i from 1 to N:
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            add i to potential_killers

    sort potential_killers
    print potential_killers as space-separated integers
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_potential_killers():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    reported_to_set = set()
    
    # Collect all members who are reported to
    for member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            reported_to_set.add(member)
    
    potential_killers = []
    
    # Find members who are not reported to by anyone
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers
    potential_killers.sort()
    
    # Print the result
    print(" ".join(map(str, potential_killers)))

```

### Explanation

- **Set Usage**: We use a set to efficiently track which members are reported to, as set lookups are average O(1) in time complexity.
- **Iterate and Check**: We iterate over each member from 1 to N and check if they are in the set of reported members. If not, they are added to the list of potential killers.
- **Sorting**: Finally, we sort the list of potential killers to ensure the output is in ascending order, as required by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The issue with the current solution is that the function `find_potential_killers()` is defined but never called. In a competitive programming environment or when reading from standard input, the function needs to be executed to process the input and produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Solution

1. **Function Execution**: Ensure that the function `find_potential_killers()` is called after its definition so that it processes the input and produces the output.

2. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, which is correct, but we need to ensure that the function is executed in the environment where the input is provided.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the output is correctly formatted and printed.

### Corrected Solution

```python
def find_potential_killers():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    reported_to_set = set()
    
    # Collect all members who are reported to
    for member in R:
        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone
            reported_to_set.add(member)
    
    potential_killers = []
    
    # Find members who are not reported to by anyone
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if i not in reported_to_set:
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers
    potential_killers.sort()
    
    # Print the result
    print(" ".join(map(str, potential_killers)))

# Call the function to execute the solution
find_potential_killers()
```

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem was a straightforward graph traversal problem where we needed to identify nodes (mafia members) that have no incoming edges (reports). My initial solution was correct and efficient, but it missed the function call, which was a simple oversight.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Tree Construction**: The official solution constructs a dictionary `tree` where each key is a member, and the value is a list of members who report to them. This is a direct representation of the reporting structure.

2. **Identification of Leaf Nodes**: The solution identifies potential killers by checking which members have an empty list in the `tree` dictionary, indicating that no one reports to them.

3. **Efficiency**: Both my solution and the official solution have similar time complexity, O(N), as they both iterate through the list of reports once and perform constant-time operations for each member.

4. **Use of Dictionary**: The official solution uses a dictionary to store the reporting structure, which is a flexible way to handle dynamic relationships. This approach is useful when the structure of the data is not strictly linear.

#### Lessons Learned:

- **Function Execution**: Always ensure that functions are called in scripts, especially in environments where the script is expected to execute upon running.
- **Data Structures**: Using dictionaries can be advantageous for representing relationships, especially when dealing with hierarchical or tree-like data.
- **Input/Output Handling**: Be mindful of how input is read and output is produced, particularly in competitive programming settings where standard input/output is used.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of careful function execution and the utility of dictionaries in representing complex data structures.
