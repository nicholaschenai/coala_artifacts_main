He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.\nChef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.\nThere are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.\nNow, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains one integer N.\nNext line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri \u2014 the person whom the ith member reports to.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a list of space-separated integers in ascending order \u2014 the indices of potential killers.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 Ri \u2264 N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.\n- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 [50 points]: N \u2264 10000\n- Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n6\n0 1 1 2 2 3\n\nOutput:\n4 5 6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe reporting structure:\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

These members are potential killers. We need to output their indices in ascending order.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Don**: The Don is the only member who reports to no one, indicated by a 0 in the list.\n2. **Track Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.\n3. **Identify Minor Criminals**: A minor criminal is a member who is not in the set of reported members.\n4. **Output**: Collect all such minor criminals and output their indices in ascending order.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the integer `N` (number of members).\n2. Read the list `R` of size `N` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom member `i+1` reports.\n3. Initialize an empty set `reported_to`.\n4.

The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads from standard input and processes the data is never executed. This is a common issue when dealing with standard input/output in competitive programming environments.\n\n        ### Steps to Fix the Issue\n\n        1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` should be called to execute the logic.\n        2. **Check Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly from standard input and processed as expected.\n        3. **Output the Result**: Make sure the result is printed to standard output.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        To address these issues, we need to ensure that the function is called and that the input/output is handled correctly.

He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books. A key observation is that the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books represents the largest subset of books that are already in the correct order. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This is because the books in the LIS do not need to be moved, and all other books need to be repositioned.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        1. Read the number of books, `N`, and the current order of books as a list, `books`.\n        2. Initialize an empty list, `lis`, to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.\n        3. For each book in `books`:\n           - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.\n           - If the position is equal to the length of `lis`, append the book to `lis`.\n           - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.\n        4. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n        5. The minimum number of moves required is `N - len(lis)`.\n        6. Print the result.\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def min_moves_to_sort_books():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            N = int(data[0])\n            books = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n            def binary_search_lis(lis, book):\n                low, high = 0, len(lis)\n                while low < high:\n                    mid = (low + high) // 2\n                    if lis[mid] < book:\n                        low = mid + 1\n                    else:\n                        high = mid\n                return low\n    \n            lis = []\n            for book in books:\n                pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)\n                if pos == len(lis):\n                    lis.append(book)\n                else:\n                    lis[pos] = book\n    \n            min_moves = N - len(lis)\n            print(min_moves)\n\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code\n\n        - We read the input and parse the number of books and their current order.\n        - We define a helper function `binary_search_lis` to find the position where a book can be placed in the `lis` to maintain the increasing order.\n        - We iterate over each book and use the helper function to determine where it fits in the `lis`.\n        - If the position is at the end of `lis`, we append the book, otherwise, we replace the existing element at that position.\n        - The length of `lis` gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n        - The minimum number of moves is calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.\n        - Finally, we print the result.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['5', '2 1 4 5 3'] Expected output: [{'2'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.

But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.\n        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall.

For each test case, we will read the number of walls and their positions, followed by the number of queries and the starting positions for each query.\n\n        2. **Wall Check**: For each query, check if the starting position (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall. A point (x, y) lies on the wall defined by a_i if x + y = a_i.\n\n        3. **Counting Walls**: If the point is not on any wall, count how many walls are between the point and the origin. This can be done by counting how many a_i values are greater than x_j + y_j.\n\n        4. **Output**: For each query, output the number of walls Chef needs to break or -1 if the starting point is on a wall.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function process_test_cases():\n            read T  # number of test cases\n            for each test case:\n                read N  # number of walls\n                read a  # list of N integers representing wall positions\n                read Q  # number of queries\n                for each query:\n                    read x, y  # starting position of Chef\n                    if x + y is in a:\n                        print -1\n                    else:\n                        count = number of elements in a greater than x + y\n                        print count\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def process_test_cases():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                a = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                Q = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n        \n                a_set = set(a)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookup\n                for _ in range(Q):\n                    x = int(data[index])\n                    y = int(data[index + 1])\n                    index += 2\n            \n                    sum_xy = x + y\n                    if sum_xy in a_set:\n                        results.append(-1)\n                    else:\n                        # Count how many a_i are greater than sum_xy\n                        count = 0\n                        for ai in a:\n                            if ai > sum_xy:\n                                count += 1\n                        results.append(count)\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        process_test_cases()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **Set for Fast Lookup**: We use a set to quickly check if a point lies on a wall.\n        - **Counting Walls**: We iterate over the list of wall positions to count how many are greater than the sum of the coordinates of the starting point.\n        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using set operations and simple iteration, ensuring it can process up to the maximum input sizes specified.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '2', '1 3', '5', '0 0', '2 0', '0 4', '1 1', '1 2'] Output: [{'0'}, {'1'}, {'2'}, {'1'}, {'-1'}]\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

Each member reports to exactly one other member, except the Don who reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a minor criminal, i.e., a member who nobody reports to. Given the reporting structure, we need to find all such members.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of members, `N`, and the list of integers `R` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom the `i-th` member reports.\n\n2. **Identify Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.\n\n3. **Determine Potential Killers**: Iterate through the list of members. A member is a potential killer if they are not in the set of reported members.\n\n4. **Output**: Collect all potential killers and print them in ascending order.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_potential_killers():\n    read N  # number of members\n    read R  # list of reporting relationships\n\n    reported_to_set = set()  # to track members who are reported to\n\n    for each member in R:\n        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone\n            add member to reported_to_set\n\n    potential_killers = []\n    for i from 1 to N:\n        if i not in reported_to_set:\n            add i to potential_killers\n\n    sort potential_killers\n    print potential_killers as space-separated integers\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n    reported_to_set = set()\n    \n    # Collect all members who are reported to\n    for member in R:\n        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone\n            reported_to_set.add(member)\n    \n    potential_killers = []\n    \n    # Find members who are not reported to by anyone\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if i not in reported_to_set:\n            potential_killers.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the potential killers\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, potential_killers)))\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Set Usage**: We use a set to efficiently track which members are reported to, as set lookups are average O(1) in time complexity.\n- **Iterate and Check**: We iterate over each member from 1 to N and check if they are in the set of reported members. If not, they are added to the list of potential killers.\n- **Sorting**: Finally, we sort the list of potential killers to ensure the output is in ascending order, as required by the problem statement."

In a competitive programming environment or when reading from standard input, the function needs to be executed to process the input and produce the output.\n\n### Steps to Correct the Solution\n\n1. **Function Execution**: Ensure that the function `find_potential_killers()` is called after its definition so that it processes the input and produces the output.\n\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, which is correct, but we need to ensure that the function is executed in the environment where the input is provided.\n\n3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the output is correctly formatted and printed.\n\n### Corrected Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n    reported_to_set = set()\n    \n    # Collect all members who are reported to\n    for member in R:\n        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone\n            reported_to_set.add(member)\n    \n    potential_killers = []\n    \n    # Find members who are not reported to by anyone\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if i not in reported_to_set:\n            potential_killers.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the potential killers\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, potential_killers)))\n\n# Call the function to execute the solution\nfind_potential_killers()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Correction\n\n- **Function Call**: By adding the call to `find_potential_killers()` at the end of the script, we ensure that the function is executed when the script runs. This allows the input to be processed and the output to be generated as expected.\n- **Standard Input/Output**: The function reads from standard input and writes to standard output, which is typical in competitive programming and aligns with the problem requirements."

The description of T test cases follows.\n        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation.

Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.\n    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.\n    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct fixed this issue.\n    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n        scores = [10] * N\n        for i, j, k in questions:\n            for student in range(i, j + 1):\n                scores[student] *= k\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N\n        return mean_score\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            questions = []\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i = int(data[index]) - 1\n                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n                k = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                questions.append((i, j, k))\n            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n            results.append(result)\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to generate a specific pattern based on an integer \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. The pattern required was a sequence of lines where each line \\( i \\) (0-indexed) contains the string \"10\" repeated \\( i+1 \\) times. The challenge was to correctly interpret the pattern and implement it efficiently.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding that the pattern alternates between \"1\" and \"0\" starting with \"1\" for each line.\n    - **Iterative Construction**: Using loops to construct each line of the pattern based on the current index.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - Initially, I misunderstood the pattern as a numeric sequence, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct approach was to focus on alternating characters.\n    - The solution involved iterating over each test case and constructing each line by alternating \"1\" and \"0\" for the required number of times.\n\n    ### Lessons Learned:\n    - **Pattern Construction**: When dealing with pattern problems, it's crucial to carefully analyze the example outputs to understand the underlying logic.\n    - **Iterative Logic**: Using loops effectively to build strings based on index values can simplify the problem-solving process.\n    - **Debugging**: When the output doesn't match expectations, revisiting the problem statement and examples can help realign the solution approach.\n\n    ### Final Solution:\n    The final solution involved reading input values, iterating over each test case, and generating the required pattern by alternating \"1\" and \"0\" for each line. This approach successfully passed all test cases.\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(data[0])\n        # Read each test case value\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        # For each test case\n        for K in test_cases:\n            # Generate K lines\n            for i in range(K):\n                # Start with \"1\" and alternate between \"0\" and \"1\"\n                line = ''.join('1' if j % 2 == 0 else '0' for j in range(i + 1))\n                # Print the line\n                print(line)\n\n    # Call the function to execute the pattern generation\n    generate_pattern()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem requirements and iteratively refining the solution to meet those requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

My initial solution was correct and efficient, but it missed the function call, which was a simple oversight.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Tree Construction**: The official solution constructs a dictionary `tree` where each key is a member, and the value is a list of members who report to them. This is a direct representation of the reporting structure.\n\n2. **Identification of Leaf Nodes**: The solution identifies potential killers by checking which members have an empty list in the `tree` dictionary, indicating that no one reports to them.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: Both my solution and the official solution have similar time complexity, O(N), as they both iterate through the list of reports once and perform constant-time operations for each member.\n\n4. **Use of Dictionary**: The official solution uses a dictionary to store the reporting structure, which is a flexible way to handle dynamic relationships. This approach is useful when the structure of the data is not strictly linear.\n\n#### Lessons Learned:\n\n- **Function Execution**: Always ensure that functions are called in scripts, especially in environments where the script is expected to execute upon running.\n- **Data Structures**: Using dictionaries can be advantageous for representing relationships, especially when dealing with hierarchical or tree-like data.\n- **Input/Output Handling**: Be mindful of how input is read and output is produced, particularly in competitive programming settings where standard input/output is used.\n\nOverall, the problem reinforced the importance of careful function execution and the utility of dictionaries in representing complex data structures."

It identifies members who are not reported to by anyone else, considering them as potential killers. These members are collected into a list, which is then sorted. Finally, the sorted list of potential killers is printed as a space-separated string.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to identify elements in a hierarchical structure that do not have any dependencies or connections pointing to them. This is common in organizational structures, dependency graphs, or network topologies where you need to find nodes with no incoming edges. For example, in a corporate hierarchy, identifying employees who do not have any subordinates can be crucial for understanding the structure or for tasks like downsizing. Similarly, in software dependency graphs, finding packages or modules that are not depended upon by others can help in optimizing or cleaning up unused code. This problem also highlights the importance of understanding tree structures and how to efficiently process them to find specific nodes based on their relationships."
