    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to identify potential killers in a mafia organization. The mafia is structured hierarchically with a single Don at the top. Each member reports to exactly one other member, except the Don who reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a minor criminal, i.e., a member who nobody reports to. Given the reporting structure, we need to find all such members.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of members, `N`, and the list of integers `R` where `R[i]` indicates the person to whom the `i-th` member reports.\n\n2. **Identify Reported Members**: Create a set to keep track of all members who are reported to by others.\n\n3. **Determine Potential Killers**: Iterate through the list of members. A member is a potential killer if they are not in the set of reported members.\n\n4. **Output**: Collect all potential killers and print them in ascending order.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_potential_killers():\n    read N  # number of members\n    read R  # list of reporting relationships\n\n    reported_to_set = set()  # to track members who are reported to\n\n    for each member in R:\n        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone\n            add member to reported_to_set\n\n    potential_killers = []\n    for i from 1 to N:\n        if i not in reported_to_set:\n            add i to potential_killers\n\n    sort potential_killers\n    print potential_killers as space-separated integers\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    R = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n    reported_to_set = set()\n    \n    # Collect all members who are reported to\n    for member in R:\n        if member != 0:  # Don is not reported to anyone\n            reported_to_set.add(member)\n    \n    potential_killers = []\n    \n    # Find members who are not reported to by anyone\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if i not in reported_to_set:\n            potential_killers.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the potential killers\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, potential_killers)))\n\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Set Usage**: We use a set to efficiently track which members are reported to, as set lookups are average O(1) in time complexity.\n- **Iterate and Check**: We iterate over each member from 1 to N and check if they are in the set of reported members. If not, they are added to the list of potential killers.\n- **Sorting**: Finally, we sort the list of potential killers to ensure the output is in ascending order, as required by the problem statement.",
