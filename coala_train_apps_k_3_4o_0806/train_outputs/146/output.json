    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns into their repeated forms.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will use a stack to help decode the string. The stack will help us manage nested patterns.\n   - As we iterate through the string:\n     - If we encounter a digit, it indicates the start of a new pattern. We will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.\n     - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it marks the start of an encoded string. We push it onto the stack to signify this.\n     - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded string. We will pop elements from the stack until we find the matching `[`, then repeat the string the number of times specified by the number before the `[`.\n     - If we encounter a letter, we add it to the current string being built.\n   - Finally, the stack will contain the fully decoded string.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function decodeString(s):\n       stack = []\n       current_string = \"\"\n       current_number = 0\n\n       for each character in s:\n           if character is a digit:\n               update current_number to include this digit\n           else if character is '[':\n               push current_string and current_number onto the stack\n               reset current_string and current_number\n           else if character is ']':\n               pop number from stack\n               pop previous_string from stack\n               current_string = previous_string + (current_string repeated number times)\n           else:\n               add character to current_string\n\n       return current_string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and numbers\n        stack = []\n        # This will hold the current string being processed\n        current_string = \"\"\n        # This will hold the current number being processed\n        current_number = 0\n\n        # Iterate over each character in the input string\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                # If the character is a digit, update the current number\n                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)\n            elif char == '[':\n                # If the character is '[', push the current string and number onto the stack\n                stack.append((current_string, current_number))\n                # Reset the current string and number\n                current_string = \"\"\n                current_number = 0\n            elif char == ']':\n                # If the character is ']', pop from the stack\n                previous_string, number = stack.pop()\n                # Repeat the current string 'number' times and append to the previous string\n                current_string = previous_string + current_string * number\n            else:\n                # If the character is a letter, add it to the current string\n                current_string += char\n\n        # Return the fully decoded string\n        return current_string\n```\n\nThis solution uses a stack to manage nested patterns and builds the decoded string by processing each character in the input string.",
