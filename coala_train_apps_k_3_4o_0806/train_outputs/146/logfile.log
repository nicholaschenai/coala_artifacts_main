## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a string that is encoded using a specific format: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a substring that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such encoded patterns. The input string is guaranteed to be valid, meaning it will not contain any malformed brackets or unexpected characters.

## Conceptual Solution

To decode the string, we need to process it character by character. We can use a stack to help manage nested encoded patterns. Here's the plan:

1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and numbers.
2. Iterate over each character in the string:
   - If the character is a digit, build the complete number (since numbers can have multiple digits).
   - If the character is `[`, push the current number and the current string onto the stack, then reset them.
   - If the character is `]`, pop from the stack to get the last string and the number, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last string.
   - If the character is a letter, append it to the current string.
3. At the end of the iteration, the current string will contain the fully decoded string.

## Pseudocode

```
function decodeString(s):
    stack = []
    current_string = ""
    current_number = 0

    for each character in s:
        if character is a digit:
            update current_number
        else if character is '[':
            push (current_string, current_number) to stack
            reset current_string to ""
            reset current_number to 0
        else if character is ']':
            pop (last_string, number) from stack
            current_string = last_string + (current_string repeated number times)
        else:
            append character to current_string

    return current_string
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and numbers
        stack = []
        current_string = ""
        current_number = 0

        # Iterate over each character in the input string
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # If the character is a digit, update the current number
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                # If the character is '[', push the current string and number onto the stack
                stack.append((current_string, current_number))
                # Reset the current string and number
                current_string = ""
                current_number = 0
            elif char == ']':
                # If the character is ']', pop from the stack
                last_string, number = stack.pop()
                # Repeat the current string 'number' times and append to the last string
                current_string = last_string + current_string * number
            else:
                # If the character is a letter, append it to the current string
                current_string += char

        # Return the fully decoded string
        return current_string
```

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We need to generate a pattern based on an integer \( K \) for multiple test cases. For each test case, given an integer \( K \), we need to print a pattern of numbers. The pattern consists of \( K \) lines, where each line \( i \) (0-indexed) contains the string "10" repeated \( i+1 \) times.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           - Read the number of test cases \( T \).
           - For each test case, read the integer \( K \).
           - For each integer \( K \), generate \( K \) lines.
           - Each line \( i \) should contain the string "10" repeated \( i+1 \) times.
           - Print each line immediately after it is constructed.

        3. **Pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
               for each K in test_cases:
                   for i from 0 to K-1:
                       # Generate the line pattern
                       line = "10" * (i + 1)
                       # Print the line
                       print(line)
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def generate_pattern():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            # Read the number of test cases
            T = int(data[0])
            # Read each test case value
            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
            # For each test case
            for K in test_cases:
                # Generate K lines
                for i in range(K):
                    # Each line is "10" repeated (i+1) times
                    line = "10" * (i + 1)
                    # Print the line
                    print(line)

        # Call the function to execute the pattern generation
        generate_pattern()
        ```

        This code reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and prints the required pattern for each value of \( K \). Each line in the pattern is constructed by repeating the string "10" a specific number of times, as determined by the current line index.

    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong:

        1. **Understanding the Pattern:**
           - For each test case with integer \( K \), we need to print \( K \) lines.
           - Each line \( i \) (0-indexed) should contain the string "10" repeated \( i+1 \) times.
           - The expected output for each test case is a block of lines, each line being a repetition of "10".

        2. **Reviewing the Code:**
           - The code reads the number of test cases \( T \) and the list of test cases.
           - For each test case, it generates \( K \) lines.
           - Each line is constructed by repeating "10" \( i+1 \) times.

        3. **Identifying the Mistake:**
           - The code correctly generates the pattern for each test case, but it seems to be printing the lines in a continuous manner without separating the outputs of different test cases.
           - The expected output format might require a separation between the outputs of different test cases, which is not handled in the current code.

        4. **Solution Correction:**
           - Ensure that the output for each test case is separated properly.
           - This can be done by adding a blank line or some form of separation between the outputs of different test cases if required by the problem statement.

        5. **Revised Solution:**

        ```python
        def generate_pattern():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            # Read the number of test cases
            T = int(data[0])
            # Read each test case value
            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
            # For each test case
            for K in test_cases:
                # Generate K lines
                for i in range(K):
                    # Each line is "10" repeated (i+1) times
                    line = "10" * (i + 1)
                    # Print the line
                    print(line)
                # Print a blank line to separate test cases if needed
                # print()  # Uncomment this line if a blank line is needed between test cases

        # Call the function to execute the pattern generation
        generate_pattern()
        ```

        - The code now includes a comment about adding a blank line between test cases. Uncomment the `print()` line if the problem requires separation between test case outputs. This will ensure that the outputs are distinct and match the expected format.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's address the problem by carefully analyzing the pattern and ensuring the code correctly implements the required logic. The task is to generate a pattern for each test case based on the integer \( K \). For each test case, we need to print \( K \) lines, where each line \( i \) (0-indexed) contains the string "10" repeated \( i+1 \) times.

        Here's the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def generate_pattern():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            # Read the number of test cases
            T = int(data[0])
            # Read each test case value
            test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
            # For each test case
            for K in test_cases:
                # Generate K lines
                for i in range(K):
                    # Each line is "10" repeated (i+1) times
                    line = "10" * (i + 1)
                    # Print the line
                    print(line)

        # Call the function to execute the pattern generation
        generate_pattern()
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code:

        - **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the number of test cases \( T \) is extracted. Each test case value \( K \) is stored in a list `test_cases`.
        - **Pattern Generation**: For each test case, iterate from 0 to \( K-1 \) to generate each line of the pattern. For each line \( i \), the string "10" is repeated \( i+1 \) times.
        - **Output**: Each line is printed immediately after it is constructed. This ensures that the output format matches the expected pattern for each test case.

[Reflection]:
    In this problem, the task was to iteratively remove occurrences of the substring "abc" from a given string until no such substring remains. The solution I provided was functionally correct, but I initially forgot to call the function, which led to no output being produced. This oversight highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially in competitive programming environments where input and output are handled through standard I/O.

    The official solution uses a similar approach to mine, employing a `while` loop to repeatedly remove "abc" from the string using the `replace` method. The key difference is that the official solution uses `s.count("abc") != 0` to check for the presence of "abc", while my solution used `'abc' in s`. Both methods are effective, but using `count` explicitly checks for the number of occurrences, which can be slightly more informative if needed.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively addressed the task. The main takeaway is the importance of ensuring that the function is called and that input/output handling is correctly implemented in a script. This experience reinforces the need for attention to detail in coding, especially in environments where the execution flow is not immediately visible.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer and `encoded_string` is a string that needs to be repeated `k` times. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns into their repeated forms.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will use a stack to help decode the string. The stack will help us manage nested patterns.
   - As we iterate through the string:
     - If we encounter a digit, it indicates the start of a new pattern. We will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.
     - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it marks the start of an encoded string. We push it onto the stack to signify this.
     - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded string. We will pop elements from the stack until we find the matching `[`, then repeat the string the number of times specified by the number before the `[`.
     - If we encounter a letter, we add it to the current string being built.
   - Finally, the stack will contain the fully decoded string.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function decodeString(s):
       stack = []
       current_string = ""
       current_number = 0

       for each character in s:
           if character is a digit:
               update current_number to include this digit
           else if character is '[':
               push current_string and current_number onto the stack
               reset current_string and current_number
           else if character is ']':
               pop number from stack
               pop previous_string from stack
               current_string = previous_string + (current_string repeated number times)

    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to decode a string that follows a specific pattern of encoding: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The challenge was to handle nested patterns and ensure that the decoding process correctly interprets the structure of the input string.

The strategy that worked involved using a stack to manage the nested patterns. As we iterated through the string, we pushed the current string and number onto the stack whenever we encountered an opening bracket `[`. This allowed us to handle nested structures by keeping track of the context before the bracket. When a closing bracket `]` was encountered, we popped from the stack to retrieve the previous context and repeated the current string the specified number of times.

This approach effectively handled both simple and nested patterns, ensuring that the decoded string was constructed correctly. The use of a stack was crucial in managing the nested nature of the encoding, allowing us to backtrack and repeat strings as needed.

The solution was implemented successfully without any unexpected errors, and the logic was straightforward once the stack-based approach was identified. This problem reinforced the utility of stacks in handling nested structures and parsing tasks.

     - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it marks the start of an encoded string. We push it onto the stack to signify this.
     - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded string. We will pop elements from the stack until we find the matching `[`, then repeat the string the number of times specified by the number before the `[`.
     - If we encounter a letter, we add it to the current string being built.
   - Finally, the stack will contain the fully decoded string.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function decodeString(s):
       stack = []
       current_string = ""
       current_number = 0

       for each character in s:
           if character is a digit:
               update current_number to include this digit
           else if character is '[':
               push current_string and current_number onto the stack
               reset current_string and current_number
           else if character is ']':
               pop number from stack
               pop previous_string from stack
               current_string = previous_string + (current_string repeated number times)
           else:
               add character to current_string

       return current_string
   ```

    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and numbers
        stack = []
        # This will hold the current string being processed

        current_number = 0

        # Iterate over each character in the input string
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # If the character is a digit, update the current number
                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                # If the character is '[', push the current string and number onto the stack
                stack.append((current_string, current_number))
                # Reset the current string and number
                current_string = ""
                current_number = 0
            elif char == ']':
                # If the character is ']', pop from the stack
                previous_string, number = stack.pop()
                # Repeat the current string 'number' times and append to the previous string
                current_string = previous_string + current_string * number
            else:
                # If the character is a letter, add it to the current string
                current_string += char

        # Return the fully decoded string
        return current_string
```

This solution uses a stack to manage nested patterns and builds the decoded string by processing each character in the input string.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for decoding an encoded string, the approach I used was quite similar to the official solution, and both passed the test cases successfully. However, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:

1. **Stack Utilization:**
   - Both solutions use a stack to manage nested patterns, which is essential for handling the recursive nature of the encoding.
   - The official solution initializes the stack with a base element `["", 1]`, which simplifies the handling of the final decoded string. This ensures that the stack always has an element to append to, even at the top level.

2. **Handling Numbers:**
   - In my solution, I used a `current_number` variable to build the number as we encounter digits. The official solution uses a `num` string to accumulate digits and converts it to an integer when needed. This approach is slightly more flexible in handling multi-digit numbers.

3. **Appending Characters:**
   - The official solution directly appends characters to the string stored in the stack's top element. This is a more concise way to manage the current string being built, as it avoids the need for a separate `current_string` variable.

4. **Efficiency and Clarity:**
   - Both solutions are efficient in terms of time complexity, as they process each character in the string once. However, the official solution is slightly more elegant in its handling of the stack and string concatenation, which can be beneficial for readability and maintenance.

Overall, the official solution provides a slightly more streamlined approach by initializing the stack with a base element and directly managing the current string within the stack. This can be a useful pattern to remember for similar problems involving nested structures and recursive processing.

[Problem]
    Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


    The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


    You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

    Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


    Examples:

    s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
    s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
    s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".
