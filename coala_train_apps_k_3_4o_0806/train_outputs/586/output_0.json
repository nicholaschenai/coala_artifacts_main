    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem involves a programming competition where teams submit their scores. Due to an error, the order of characters in team names was scrambled, but each team name is unique in terms of character frequency. After the competition, we need to calculate the total score for each team and print the results in descending order of scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their original team name.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions in the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include scrambled team names and scores.\n\n2. **Normalize Team Names**: For each team name, sort the characters to create a normalized form. This will help in identifying the team regardless of the character order.\n\n3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to map the normalized team name to its total score. As we read each submission, update the score for the corresponding team.\n\n4. **Sorting and Output**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by score in descending order and then by the original team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied. Print the results.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction process_test_case(N, R, submissions):\n    team_scores = {}\n    original_names = {}\n\n    for each submission in submissions:\n        team_name, score = submission\n        normalized_name = sort_characters(team_name)\n        \n        if normalized_name not in team_scores:\n            team_scores[normalized_name] = 0\n            original_names[normalized_name] = team_name\n        \n        team_scores[normalized_name] += score\n\n    sorted_teams = sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names)\n    \n    for team in sorted_teams:\n        print original_names[team], team_scores[team]\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read N, R\n        submissions = []\n        for i in range(N):\n            read team_name, score\n            submissions.append((team_name, score))\n        \n        process_test_case(N, R, submissions)\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef sort_characters(s):\n    return ''.join(sorted(s))\n\ndef sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names):\n    # Create a list of tuples (normalized_name, score, original_name)\n    teams = [(name, score, original_names[name]) for name, score in team_scores.items()]\n    # Sort by score descending, then by original name lexicographically\n    teams.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[2]))\n    return [name for name, _, _ in teams]\n\ndef process_test_case(N, R, submissions):\n    team_scores = {}\n    original_names = {}\n\n    for team_name, score in submissions:\n        normalized_name = sort_characters(team_name)\n        \n        if normalized_name not in team_scores:\n            team_scores[normalized_name] = 0\n            original_names[normalized_name] = team_name\n        \n        team_scores[normalized_name] += score\n\n    sorted_teams = sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names)\n    \n    for team in sorted_teams:\n        print(original_names[team], team_scores[team])\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())\n        index += 1\n        submissions = []\n        \n        for _ in range(N):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)\n            team_name = line[0]\n            score = int(line[1])\n            submissions.append((team_name, score))\n            index += 1\n        \n        process_test_case(N, R, submissions)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **sort_characters**: This helper function sorts the characters of a string to create a normalized form of the team name.\n- **sort_teams_by_score_and_name**: This function sorts the teams based on their scores in descending order and by their original names lexicographically if scores are tied.\n- **process_test_case**: This function processes each test case by reading submissions, normalizing team names, aggregating scores, and then sorting and printing the results.\n- **main**: This function handles input reading and calls the processing function for each test case.
