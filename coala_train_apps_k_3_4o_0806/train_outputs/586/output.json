This ensures that all submissions for a team are summed correctly.\n\n2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting function is verified to ensure it sorts by score in descending order and by the original team name lexicographically. This is crucial for meeting the problem's requirements.\n\n3. **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to match the expected format, ensuring that the team names and scores are printed correctly. The `strip()` function is used to handle any extra spaces in the team names.\n\nThis revised solution should address the issues identified and produce the correct output for the given test cases.",
