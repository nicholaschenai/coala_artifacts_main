    "summary": "### Summary of Problem-Solving Experience\n\nThis problem involved handling scrambled team names and aggregating scores for a programming competition. The core concepts tested included string manipulation, dictionary usage for aggregation, and sorting with multiple criteria.\n\n#### Key Concepts and Patterns\n\n1. **String Normalization**: The problem required normalizing team names by sorting their characters. This allowed us to uniquely identify teams regardless of the order of characters in their names.\n\n2. **Score Aggregation**: Using a dictionary to map normalized team names to their cumulative scores was crucial. This ensured that all submissions for a team were correctly summed.\n\n3. **Sorting with Multiple Criteria**: The solution required sorting teams first by their scores in descending order and then by their original names in lexicographical order. This was achieved using a custom sorting key.\n\n#### Strategies and Fixes\n\n- **Initial Mistakes**: Initially, there were issues with score aggregation and sorting logic. Scores were not being summed correctly, and the sorting did not adhere to the problem's requirements.\n\n- **Effective Fixes**: The use of a dictionary to store scores and original names, combined with a careful sorting function, resolved these issues. Ensuring the output format matched expectations was also crucial.\n\n- **Unexpected Errors**: Handling input and output formatting was a minor challenge, particularly ensuring that team names were stripped of extra spaces.\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing, the utility of dictionaries for aggregation tasks, and the need for precise sorting logic when dealing with multiple criteria.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process\n\nThe problem involved handling scrambled team names and aggregating scores, which required careful attention to detail in both the logic and implementation. Here are some key insights and learnings from the process:\n\n1. **Normalization of Team Names**: The core challenge was to handle scrambled team names. The solution involved normalizing team names by sorting their characters. This approach ensured that all variations of a team name were treated as the same entity, which was crucial for accurate score aggregation.\n\n2. **Score Aggregation**: A dictionary was used to map normalized team names to their cumulative scores. This allowed for efficient updating and retrieval of scores, ensuring that all submissions for a team were correctly summed.\n\n3. **Sorting Logic**: The requirement to sort teams by score in descending order and by name lexicographically when scores were tied was handled using a custom sorting function. This involved creating tuples that included both the score and the original team name, allowing for straightforward sorting using Python's built-in capabilities.\n\n4. **Efficient Input Handling**: Given the constraints, efficient input handling was necessary. Using `sys.stdin.read` for bulk input reading and processing it line by line helped manage large datasets effectively.\n\n5. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the output matched the expected format was critical. This involved careful handling of spaces and line breaks, which can often be a source of errors in competitive programming.\n\n### Comparison with the Official Solution\n\nThe official solution provided a different perspective on handling the problem:\n\n- **Use of Large Numbers for Sorting**: The official solution used a clever trick of subtracting scores from a large number (`10**10`) to facilitate sorting by score in descending order. This approach is both efficient and elegant, as it leverages Python's ability to handle large integers seamlessly.\n\n- **Direct Comparison with Sorted Names**: Instead of maintaining a separate dictionary for scores, the official solution directly compared sorted team names to update scores. This approach simplifies the logic and reduces the need for additional data structures.\n\nOverall, the official solution offered a more concise and potentially more efficient approach, particularly in how it handled sorting and score aggregation. This experience highlighted the importance of exploring different strategies and leveraging Python's strengths in handling large numbers and sorting.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes multiple test cases, each specifying the number of teams and submissions. For each test case, it processes a list of team submissions, where each submission consists of a team name and a score. It normalizes team names by sorting their characters and aggregates scores for teams with the same normalized name. After processing all submissions, it sorts the teams by their total scores in descending order and by their original names lexicographically in case of ties. Finally, it prints the original team names along with their total scores in the sorted order.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to handle and process data where the order of elements does not matter, such as when dealing with anagrams or unordered sets. It is particularly applicable in competitive programming or data processing tasks where you need to normalize data to ensure consistency, such as sorting characters in strings to identify equivalent groups. Additionally, this solution demonstrates how to efficiently manage and sort data based on multiple criteria, which is a common requirement in data analysis and reporting tasks. The use of sorting by score and then lexicographically is a pattern that can be applied in any situation where you need to rank items based on primary and secondary criteria."
