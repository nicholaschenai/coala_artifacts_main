## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We have a programming competition where each team submits their team name and score. Due to an error, the order of characters in team names got scrambled, but each team name is unique based on character frequency. We need to calculate the total score for each team and print the results in descending order of scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour.
2. **Team Identification**: Use a dictionary to map sorted team names (as keys) to their actual team names and scores.
3. **Score Aggregation**: For each submission, sort the team name to find the correct team and add the score to their total.
4. **Sorting and Output**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by score in descending order, then by team name lexicographically if scores are tied. Print the results.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case():
    read N, R
    initialize team_scores as an empty dictionary
    initialize team_names as an empty dictionary

    for i from 1 to R:
        read team_name, score
        sorted_name = sort_characters(team_name)
        team_scores[sorted_name] = score
        team_names[sorted_name] = team_name

    for i from 1 to N-R:
        read scrambled_name, score
        sorted_name = sort_characters(scrambled_name)
        team_scores[sorted_name] += score

    create a list of (team_name, score) from team_scores and team_names
    sort the list by score descending, then by team_name lexicographically

    for each team in sorted list:
        print team_name, score

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        process_test_case()
```

### Python Solution

```python
def process_test_case():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    N, R = map(int, data[0].split())
    team_scores = {}
    team_names = {}
    
    # Process the first R submissions
    for i in range(1, R + 1):
        line = data[i].strip()
        team_name, score = line.rsplit(' ', 1)
        score = int(score)
        sorted_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))
        team_scores[sorted_name] = score
        team_names[sorted_name] = team_name
    
    # Process the remaining N-R submissions
    for i in range(R + 1, N + 1):
        line = data[i].strip()
        scrambled_name, score = line.rsplit(' ', 1)
        score = int(score)
        sorted_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_name))
        if sorted_name in team_scores:
            team_scores[sorted_name] += score
    
    # Prepare the result list
    result = [(team_names[sorted_name], score) for sorted_name, score in team_scores.items()]
    
    # Sort by score descending, then by team name lexicographically
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
    
    # Print the result
    for team_name, score in result:
        print(f"{team_name} {score}")

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())
        process_test_case()
        index += N + 1

main()
```

This solution reads input directly from standard input, processes each test case by aggregating scores based on sorted team names, and outputs the results in the required order.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of transforming segments with minimal operations, the core concept was to ensure the operations are both minimal in number and lexicographically smallest. The problem required careful attention to the order of operations, which should be R+, L+, R-, L- to achieve the desired lexicographical order.

    ### Key Learnings:

    1. **Lexicographical Order**: The order of operations is crucial. Initially, I misunderstood the order, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct order is R+, L+, R-, L-.

    2. **Handling Empty Operations**: When no operations are needed, the output should be an empty string. This was initially overlooked, leading to incorrect outputs for cases with no required transformations.

    3. **Index Management**: Properly managing the index while parsing input data is essential, especially when reading from a single input block.

    ### Strategies:

    - **Correct Order of Operations**: Adjusting the order of appending operations to match the expected lexicographical order was key to solving the problem.
    - **Iterative Debugging**: By iteratively testing and adjusting the order of operations, I was able to align the output with the expected results.

    ### Code Snippet:

    ```python
    def transform_segments():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            segments = []
        
            for _ in range(N):
                L = int(data[index])
                R = int(data[index + 1])
                segments.append((L, R))
                index += 2
        
            total_operations = 0
            operations_sequence = []
        
            for i in range(N - 1):
                L1, R1 = segments[i]
                L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]
            
                delta_L = L2 - L1
                delta_R = R2 - R1
            
                if delta_R > 0:
                    operations_sequence.append("R+" * delta_R)
                if delta_L > 0:
                    operations_sequence.append("L+" * delta_L)
                if delta_R < 0:
                    operations_sequence.append("R-" * (-delta_R))
                if delta_L < 0:
                    operations_sequence.append("L-" * (-delta_L))
            
                total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)
        
            results.append(f"{total_operations}")
            results.append("".join(operations_sequence))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    # Call the function to execute the logic
    transform_segments()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and requirements, especially when dealing with lexicographical ordering and minimal operations.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, reflecting on the official solution, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:

    1. **Data Structure Choice:**
       - The official solution uses a dictionary (`nsc`) to map scores to the number of solvers, which is a clear and direct way to handle the association between scores and solvers. This approach is slightly more intuitive than using a list of tuples, as it directly maps scores to their corresponding solver counts.

    2. **Sorting and Counting:**
       - Both solutions sort the scores and count the number of times the solver count decreases. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to iterate over pairs of consecutive scores, which is a clean and concise way to handle this logic.

    3. **Handling Ties in Difficulty:**
       - The official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) to group problems by their difficulty score, which allows for easy sorting of problems with the same difficulty. This approach is efficient and neatly handles the requirement to sort by problem index when difficulties are tied.

    4. **Output Construction:**
       - The official solution constructs the final output list by first sorting the difficulty scores and then sorting the problem indices within each difficulty group. This ensures the output is in the correct order.

    Overall, the official solution is slightly more elegant in its use of data structures and sorting logic. It effectively uses dictionaries to manage and sort the problems by difficulty, which is a useful pattern for similar problems involving sorting and grouping by multiple criteria.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

The problem involves a programming competition where teams submit their scores. Due to an error, the order of characters in team names was scrambled, but each team name is unique in terms of character frequency. After the competition, we need to calculate the total score for each team and print the results in descending order of scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their original team name.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions in the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include scrambled team names and scores.

2. **Normalize Team Names**: For each team name, sort the characters to create a normalized form. This will help in identifying the team regardless of the character order.

3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to map the normalized team name to its total score. As we read each submission, update the score for the corresponding team.

4. **Sorting and Output**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by score in descending order and then by the original team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied. Print the results.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, R, submissions):
    team_scores = {}
    original_names = {}

    for each submission in submissions:
        team_name, score = submission
        normalized_name = sort_characters(team_name)
        
        if normalized_name not in team_scores:
            team_scores[normalized_name] = 0
            original_names[normalized_name] = team_name
        
        team_scores[normalized_name] += score

    sorted_teams = sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

Upon reviewing the problem and the provided feedback, it seems there are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. **Score Aggregation**: The scores are not being aggregated correctly. The issue might be in how the scores are being summed up for each team.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic might not be correctly implemented, especially when handling ties in scores. The expected output suggests that the sorting by score and then by name is not functioning as intended.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output format might not match the expected format, which could be causing discrepancies.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Score Aggregation**: 
   - Ensure that scores are being correctly added for each team. The normalized team name should be used to aggregate scores across all submissions.

2. **Sorting Logic**:
   - Verify that the sorting is first by score in descending order and then by the original team name in lexicographical order. The sorting function should be carefully checked to ensure it adheres to these rules.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - Ensure that the output format matches the expected format exactly, including spaces and line breaks.

### Revised Solution

Let's address these issues in the revised solution:

```python
def sort_characters(s):
    return ''.join(sorted(s))

def sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names):
    # Create a list of tuples (normalized_name, score, original_name)
    teams = [(name, score, original_names[name]) for name, score in team_scores.items()]
    # Sort by score descending, then by original name lexicographically
    teams.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[2]))
    return [name for name, _, _ in teams]

def process_test_case(N, R, submissions):
    team_scores = {}
    original_names = {}

    for team_name, score in submissions:
        normalized_name = sort_characters(team_name)
        
        if normalized_name not in team_scores:
            team_scores[normalized_name] = 0
            original_names[normalized_name] = team_name
        
        team_scores[normalized_name] += score

    sorted_teams = sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names)
    
    for team in sorted_teams:
        print(original_names[team], team_scores[team])

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())
        index += 1
        submissions = []
        
        for _ in range(N):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)
            team_name = line[0].strip()
            score = int(line[1])
            submissions.append((team_name, score))
            index += 1
        
        process_test_case(N, R, submissions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Fixes

- **Score Aggregation**: The code now correctly aggregates scores using the normalized team name as the key in the dictionary.
- **Sorting Logic**: The sorting function is verified to ensure it sorts by score in descending order and by the original team name lexicographically.
- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to match the expected format, ensuring that the team names and scores are printed correctly.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

The problem involves a programming competition where teams submit their scores. Due to an error, the order of characters in team names was scrambled, but each team name is unique in terms of character frequency. After the competition, we need to calculate the total score for each team and print the results in descending order of scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their original team name.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions in the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include scrambled team names and scores.

2. **Normalize Team Names**: For each team name, sort the characters to create a normalized form. This will help in identifying the team regardless of the character order.

3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to map the normalized team name to its total score. As we read each submission, update the score for the corresponding team.

4. **Sorting and Output**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by score in descending order and then by the original team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied. Print the results.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, R, submissions):
    team_scores = {}
    original_names = {}

    for each submission in submissions:
        team_name, score = submission
        normalized_name = sort_characters(team_name)
        
        if normalized_name not in team_scores:
            team_scores[normalized_name] = 0
            original_names[normalized_name] = team_name
        
        team_scores[normalized_name] += score

    sorted_teams = sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names)
    
    for team in sorted_teams:
        print original_names[team], team_scores[team]

function main():
    read T
    for each test case:
        read N, R
        submissions = []

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, reflecting on the official solution, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:

    1. **Data Structure Choice:**
       - The official solution uses a dictionary (`nsc`) to map scores to the number of solvers, which is a clear and direct way to handle the association between scores and solvers. This approach is slightly more intuitive than using a list of tuples, as it directly maps scores to their corresponding solver counts.

    2. **Sorting and Counting:**
       - Both solutions sort the scores and count the number of times the solver count decreases. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to iterate over pairs of consecutive scores, which is a clean and concise way to handle this logic.

    3. **Handling Ties in Difficulty:**
       - The official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) to group problems by their difficulty score, which allows for easy sorting of problems with the same difficulty. This approach is efficient and neatly handles the requirement to sort by problem index when difficulties are tied.

    4. **Output Construction:**
       - The official solution constructs the final output list by first sorting the difficulty scores and then sorting the problem indices within each difficulty group. This ensures the output is in the correct order.

    Overall, the official solution is slightly more elegant in its use of data structures and sorting logic. It effectively uses dictionaries to manage and sort the problems by difficulty, which is a useful pattern for similar problems involving sorting and grouping by multiple criteria.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of transforming segments with minimal operations, the core concept was to ensure the operations are both minimal in number and lexicographically smallest. The problem required careful attention to the order of operations, which should be R+, L+, R-, L- to achieve the desired lexicographical order.

    ### Key Learnings:

    1. **Lexicographical Order**: The order of operations is crucial. Initially, I misunderstood the order, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct order is R+, L+, R-, L-.

    2. **Handling Empty Operations**: When no operations are needed, the output should be an empty string. This was initially overlooked, leading to incorrect outputs for cases with no required transformations.

    3. **Index Management**: Properly managing the index while parsing input data is essential, especially when reading from a single input block.

    ### Strategies:

    - **Correct Order of Operations**: Adjusting the order of appending operations to match the expected lexicographical order was key to solving the problem.
    - **Iterative Debugging**: By iteratively testing and adjusting the order of operations, I was able to align the output with the expected results.

    ### Code Snippet:

    ```python
    def transform_segments():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

### Key Fixes and Improvements

1. **Score Aggregation**: The code now correctly aggregates scores using the normalized team name as the key in the dictionary. This ensures that all submissions for a team are summed correctly.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting function is verified to ensure it sorts by score in descending order and by the original team name lexicographically. This is crucial for meeting the problem's requirements.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to match the expected format, ensuring that the team names and scores are printed correctly. The `strip()` function is used to handle any extra spaces in the team names.

This revised solution should address the issues identified and produce the correct output for the given test cases.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

For each testcase,print the scoreboard.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

The problem involves a programming competition where teams submit their scores. Due to an error, the order of characters in team names was scrambled, but each team name is unique in terms of character frequency. After the competition, we need to calculate the total score for each team and print the results in descending order of scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their original team name.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions in the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include scrambled team names and scores.

2. **Normalize Team Names**: For each team name, sort the characters to create a normalized form. This will help in identifying the team regardless of the character order.

3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to map the normalized team name to its total score. As we read each submission, update the score for the corresponding team.

4. **Sorting and Output**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by score in descending order and then by the original team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied. Print the results.

### Pseudocode

```
function process_test_case(N, R, submissions):
    team_scores = {}
    original_names = {}

    for each submission in submissions:
        team_name, score = submission

        if normalized_name not in team_scores:
            team_scores[normalized_name] = 0
            original_names[normalized_name] = team_name
        
        team_scores[normalized_name] += score

    sorted_teams = sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names)
    
    for team in sorted_teams:
        print original_names[team], team_scores[team]

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

Upon reviewing the problem and the provided feedback, it seems there are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. **Score Aggregation**: The scores are not being aggregated correctly. The issue might be in how the scores are being summed up for each team.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic might not be correctly implemented, especially when handling ties in scores. The expected output suggests that the sorting by score and then by name is not functioning as intended.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output format might not match the expected format, which could be causing discrepancies.

### Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Score Aggregation**: 
   - Ensure that scores are being correctly added for each team. The normalized team name should be used to aggregate scores across all submissions.

2. **Sorting Logic**:
   - Verify that the sorting is first by score in descending order and then by the original team name in lexicographical order. The sorting function should be carefully checked to ensure it adheres to these rules.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - Ensure that the output format matches the expected format exactly, including spaces and line breaks.

### Revised Solution

Let's address these issues in the revised solution:

```python

    teams = [(name, score, original_names[name]) for name, score in team_scores.items()]
    # Sort by score descending, then by original name lexicographically
    teams.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[2]))
    return [name for name, _, _ in teams]

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] ### Summary of Problem-Solving Experience

This problem involved handling scrambled team names and aggregating scores for a programming competition. The core concepts tested included string manipulation, dictionary usage for aggregation, and sorting with multiple criteria.

#### Key Concepts and Patterns

1. **String Normalization**: The problem required normalizing team names by sorting their characters. This allowed us to uniquely identify teams regardless of the order of characters in their names.

2. **Score Aggregation**: Using a dictionary to map normalized team names to their cumulative scores was crucial. This ensured that all submissions for a team were correctly summed.

3. **Sorting with Multiple Criteria**: The solution required sorting teams first by their scores in descending order and then by their original names in lexicographical order. This was achieved using a custom sorting key.

#### Strategies and Fixes

- **Initial Mistakes**: Initially, there were issues with score aggregation and sorting logic. Scores were not being summed correctly, and the sorting did not adhere to the problem's requirements.

- **Effective Fixes**: The use of a dictionary to store scores and original names, combined with a careful sorting function, resolved these issues. Ensuring the output format matched expectations was also crucial.

- **Unexpected Errors**: Handling input and output formatting was a minor challenge, particularly ensuring that team names were stripped of extra spaces.

This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing, the utility of dictionaries for aggregation tasks, and the need for precise sorting logic when dealing with multiple criteria.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$

Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

The problem involves a programming competition where teams submit their scores. Due to an error, the order of characters in team names was scrambled, but each team name is unique in terms of character frequency. After the competition, we need to calculate the total score for each team and print the results in descending order of scores. If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their original team name.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions in the first half-hour. Then, read the submissions, which include scrambled team names and scores.

2. **Normalize Team Names**: For each team name, sort the characters to create a normalized form. This will help in identifying the team regardless of the character order.

3. **Score Aggregation**: Use a dictionary to map the normalized team name to its total score. As we read each submission, update the score for the corresponding team.

4. **Sorting and Output**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by score in descending order and then by the original team name in lexicographical order if scores are tied. Print the results.

### Pseudocode

    team_scores = {}

            original_names[normalized_name] = team_name
        
        team_scores[normalized_name] += score

    sorted_teams = sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names)

### Key Fixes and Improvements

1. **Score Aggregation**: The code now correctly aggregates scores using the normalized team name as the key in the dictionary. This ensures that all submissions for a team are summed correctly.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting function is verified to ensure it sorts by score in descending order and by the original team name lexicographically. This is crucial for meeting the problem's requirements.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to match the expected format, ensuring that the team names and scores are printed correctly. The `strip()` function is used to handle any extra spaces in the team names.

This revised solution should address the issues identified and produce the correct output for the given test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process

The problem involved handling scrambled team names and aggregating scores, which required careful attention to detail in both the logic and implementation. Here are some key insights and learnings from the process:

1. **Normalization of Team Names**: The core challenge was to handle scrambled team names. The solution involved normalizing team names by sorting their characters. This approach ensured that all variations of a team name were treated as the same entity, which was crucial for accurate score aggregation.

2. **Score Aggregation**: A dictionary was used to map normalized team names to their cumulative scores. This allowed for efficient updating and retrieval of scores, ensuring that all submissions for a team were correctly summed.

3. **Sorting Logic**: The requirement to sort teams by score in descending order and by name lexicographically when scores were tied was handled using a custom sorting function. This involved creating tuples that included both the score and the original team name, allowing for straightforward sorting using Python's built-in capabilities.

4. **Efficient Input Handling**: Given the constraints, efficient input handling was necessary. Using `sys.stdin.read` for bulk input reading and processing it line by line helped manage large datasets effectively.

5. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the output matched the expected format was critical. This involved careful handling of spaces and line breaks, which can often be a source of errors in competitive programming.

### Comparison with the Official Solution

The official solution provided a different perspective on handling the problem:

- **Use of Large Numbers for Sorting**: The official solution used a clever trick of subtracting scores from a large number (`10**10`) to facilitate sorting by score in descending order. This approach is both efficient and elegant, as it leverages Python's ability to handle large integers seamlessly.

- **Direct Comparison with Sorted Names**: Instead of maintaining a separate dictionary for scores, the official solution directly compared sorted team names to update scores. This approach simplifies the logic and reduces the need for additional data structures.

Overall, the official solution offered a more concise and potentially more efficient approach, particularly in how it handled sorting and score aggregation. This experience highlighted the importance of exploring different strategies and leveraging Python's strengths in handling large numbers and sorting.

[Problem]
    Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
    $N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
    That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
    It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

    -----Input:-----Input:
    - 
    First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - 
    The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
    - 
    Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
    - 
    Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

    -----Output:-----Output:
    For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
    That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

    -----Constraints-----Constraints
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10$
    - $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
    - $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$
    - $1 \leq pi \leq 10^6$
    Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.
