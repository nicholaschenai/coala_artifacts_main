The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.\n$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. \nThat means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').\nIt is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.\n\n-----Input:-----Input:\n- \nFirst line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

Due to an error, the order of characters in team names got scrambled, but each team name is unique based on character frequency.

If two teams have the same score, they should be ordered lexicographically by their team name.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases. For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions within the first half-hour.\n2. **Team Identification**: Use a dictionary to map sorted team names (as keys) to their actual team names and scores.\n3. **Score Aggregation**: For each submission, sort the team name to find the correct team and add the score to their total.\n4. **Sorting and Output**: Once all scores are aggregated, sort the teams first by score in descending order, then by team name lexicographically if scores are tied.

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.\n    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.\n    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct fixed this issue.\n    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n        scores = [10] * N\n        for i, j, k in questions:\n            for student in range(i, j + 1):\n                scores[student] *= k\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N\n        return mean_score\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            questions = []\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i = int(data[index]) - 1\n                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n                k = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                questions.append((i, j, k))\n            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n            results.append(result)\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In tackling the problem of transforming segments with minimal operations, the core concept was to ensure the operations are both minimal in number and lexicographically smallest. The problem required careful attention to the order of operations, which should be R+, L+, R-, L- to achieve the desired lexicographical order.\n\n    ### Key Learnings:\n\n    1. **Lexicographical Order**: The order of operations is crucial. Initially, I misunderstood the order, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct order is R+, L+, R-, L-.\n\n    2. **Handling Empty Operations**: When no operations are needed, the output should be an empty string. This was initially overlooked, leading to incorrect outputs for cases with no required transformations.\n\n    3. **Index Management**: Properly managing the index while parsing input data is essential, especially when reading from a single input block.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n\n    - **Correct Order of Operations**: Adjusting the order of appending operations to match the expected lexicographical order was key to solving the problem.\n    - **Iterative Debugging**: By iteratively testing and adjusting the order of operations, I was able to align the output with the expected results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n\n    ```python\n    def transform_segments():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            segments = []\n        \n            for _ in range(N):\n                L = int(data[index])\n                R = int(data[index + 1])\n                segments.append((L, R))\n                index += 2\n        \n            total_operations = 0\n            operations_sequence = []\n        \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                L1, R1 = segments[i]\n                L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]\n            \n                delta_L = L2 - L1\n                delta_R = R2 - R1\n            \n                if delta_R > 0:\n                    operations_sequence.append(\"R+\" * delta_R)\n                if delta_L > 0:\n                    operations_sequence.append(\"L+\" * delta_L)\n                if delta_R < 0:\n                    operations_sequence.append(\"R-\" * (-delta_R))\n                if delta_L < 0:\n                    operations_sequence.append(\"L-\" * (-delta_L))\n            \n                total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)\n        \n            results.append(f\"{total_operations}\")\n            results.append(\"\".join(operations_sequence))\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    # Call the function to execute the logic\n    transform_segments()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and requirements, especially when dealing with lexicographical ordering and minimal operations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, reflecting on the official solution, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:\n\n    1. **Data Structure Choice:**\n       - The official solution uses a dictionary (`nsc`) to map scores to the number of solvers, which is a clear and direct way to handle the association between scores and solvers. This approach is slightly more intuitive than using a list of tuples, as it directly maps scores to their corresponding solver counts.\n\n    2. **Sorting and Counting:**\n       - Both solutions sort the scores and count the number of times the solver count decreases. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to iterate over pairs of consecutive scores, which is a clean and concise way to handle this logic.\n\n    3. **Handling Ties in Difficulty:**\n       - The official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) to group problems by their difficulty score, which allows for easy sorting of problems with the same difficulty. This approach is efficient and neatly handles the requirement to sort by problem index when difficulties are tied.\n\n    4. **Output Construction:**\n       - The official solution constructs the final output list by first sorting the difficulty scores and then sorting the problem indices within each difficulty group. This ensures the output is in the correct order.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is slightly more elegant in its use of data structures and sorting logic. It effectively uses dictionaries to manage and sort the problems by difficulty, which is a useful pattern for similar problems involving sorting and grouping by multiple criteria.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The sorting function should be carefully checked to ensure it adheres to these rules.\n\n3. **Output Formatting**:\n   - Ensure that the output format matches the expected format exactly, including spaces and line breaks.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nLet's address these issues in the revised solution:\n\n```python\ndef sort_characters(s):\n    return ''.join(sorted(s))\n\ndef sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names):\n    # Create a list of tuples (normalized_name, score, original_name)\n    teams = [(name, score, original_names[name]) for name, score in team_scores.items()]\n    # Sort by score descending, then by original name lexicographically\n    teams.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[2]))\n    return [name for name, _, _ in teams]\n\ndef process_test_case(N, R, submissions):\n    team_scores = {}\n    original_names = {}\n\n    for team_name, score in submissions:\n        normalized_name = sort_characters(team_name)\n        \n        if normalized_name not in team_scores:\n            team_scores[normalized_name] = 0\n            original_names[normalized_name] = team_name\n        \n        team_scores[normalized_name] += score\n\n    sorted_teams = sort_teams_by_score_and_name(team_scores, original_names)\n    \n    for team in sorted_teams:\n        print(original_names[team], team_scores[team])\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())\n        index += 1\n        submissions = []\n        \n        for _ in range(N):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)\n            team_name = line[0].strip()\n            score = int(line[1])\n            submissions.append((team_name, score))\n            index += 1\n        \n        process_test_case(N, R, submissions)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Fixes\n\n- **Score Aggregation**: The code now correctly aggregates scores using the normalized team name as the key in the dictionary.\n- **Sorting Logic**: The sorting function is verified to ensure it sorts by score in descending order and by the original team name lexicographically.\n- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to match the expected format, ensuring that the team names and scores are printed correctly.\n\nThis revised solution should address the issues identified and produce the correct output for the given test cases."

However, reflecting on the official solution, there are a few insights and differences worth noting:\n\n    1. **Data Structure Choice:**\n       - The official solution uses a dictionary (`nsc`) to map scores to the number of solvers, which is a clear and direct way to handle the association between scores and solvers. This approach is slightly more intuitive than using a list of tuples, as it directly maps scores to their corresponding solver counts.\n\n    2. **Sorting and Counting:**\n       - Both solutions sort the scores and count the number of times the solver count decreases. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to iterate over pairs of consecutive scores, which is a clean and concise way to handle this logic.\n\n    3. **Handling Ties in Difficulty:**\n       - The official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) to group problems by their difficulty score, which allows for easy sorting of problems with the same difficulty. This approach is efficient and neatly handles the requirement to sort by problem index when difficulties are tied.\n\n    4. **Output Construction:**\n       - The official solution constructs the final output list by first sorting the difficulty scores and then sorting the problem indices within each difficulty group. This ensures the output is in the correct order.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is slightly more elegant in its use of data structures and sorting logic. It effectively uses dictionaries to manage and sort the problems by difficulty, which is a useful pattern for similar problems involving sorting and grouping by multiple criteria.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In tackling the problem of transforming segments with minimal operations, the core concept was to ensure the operations are both minimal in number and lexicographically smallest. The problem required careful attention to the order of operations, which should be R+, L+, R-, L- to achieve the desired lexicographical order.\n\n    ### Key Learnings:\n\n    1. **Lexicographical Order**: The order of operations is crucial. Initially, I misunderstood the order, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct order is R+, L+, R-, L-.\n\n    2. **Handling Empty Operations**: When no operations are needed, the output should be an empty string. This was initially overlooked, leading to incorrect outputs for cases with no required transformations.\n\n    3. **Index Management**: Properly managing the index while parsing input data is essential, especially when reading from a single input block.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n\n    - **Correct Order of Operations**: Adjusting the order of appending operations to match the expected lexicographical order was key to solving the problem.\n    - **Iterative Debugging**: By iteratively testing and adjusting the order of operations, I was able to align the output with the expected results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n\n    ```python\n    def transform_segments():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            segments = []\n        \n            for _ in range(N):\n                L = int(data[index])\n                R = int(data[index + 1])\n                segments.append((L, R))\n                index += 2\n        \n            total_operations = 0\n            operations_sequence = []\n        \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                L1, R1 = segments[i]\n                L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]\n            \n                delta_L = L2 - L1\n                delta_R = R2 - R1\n            \n                if delta_R > 0:\n                    operations_sequence.append(\"R+\" * delta_R)\n                if delta_L > 0:\n                    operations_sequence.append(\"L+\" * delta_L)\n                if delta_R < 0:\n                    operations_sequence.append(\"R-\" * (-delta_R))\n                if delta_L < 0:\n                    operations_sequence.append(\"L-\" * (-delta_L))\n            \n                total_operations += abs(delta_L) + abs(delta_R)\n        \n            results.append(f\"{total_operations}\")\n            results.append(\"\".join(operations_sequence))\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    # Call the function to execute the logic\n    transform_segments()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem constraints and requirements, especially when dealing with lexicographical ordering and minimal operations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.\n    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.\n    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct fixed this issue.\n    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n        scores = [10] * N\n        for i, j, k in questions:\n            for student in range(i, j + 1):\n                scores[student] *= k\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N\n        return mean_score\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            questions = []\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i = int(data[index]) - 1\n                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n                k = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                questions.append((i, j, k))\n            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n            results.append(result)\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are some key insights and learnings from the process:\n\n1. **Normalization of Team Names**: The core challenge was to handle scrambled team names. The solution involved normalizing team names by sorting their characters. This approach ensured that all variations of a team name were treated as the same entity, which was crucial for accurate score aggregation.\n\n2. **Score Aggregation**: A dictionary was used to map normalized team names to their cumulative scores. This allowed for efficient updating and retrieval of scores, ensuring that all submissions for a team were correctly summed.\n\n3. **Sorting Logic**: The requirement to sort teams by score in descending order and by name lexicographically when scores were tied was handled using a custom sorting function. This involved creating tuples that included both the score and the original team name, allowing for straightforward sorting using Python's built-in capabilities.\n\n4. **Efficient Input Handling**: Given the constraints, efficient input handling was necessary. Using `sys.stdin.read` for bulk input reading and processing it line by line helped manage large datasets effectively.\n\n5. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the output matched the expected format was critical. This involved careful handling of spaces and line breaks, which can often be a source of errors in competitive programming.\n\n### Comparison with the Official Solution\n\nThe official solution provided a different perspective on handling the problem:\n\n- **Use of Large Numbers for Sorting**: The official solution used a clever trick of subtracting scores from a large number (`10**10`) to facilitate sorting by score in descending order. This approach is both efficient and elegant, as it leverages Python's ability to handle large integers seamlessly.\n\n- **Direct Comparison with Sorted Names**: Instead of maintaining a separate dictionary for scores, the official solution directly compared sorted team names to update scores. This approach simplifies the logic and reduces the need for additional data structures.\n\nOverall, the official solution offered a more concise and potentially more efficient approach, particularly in how it handled sorting and score aggregation. This experience highlighted the importance of exploring different strategies and leveraging Python's strengths in handling large numbers and sorting."
