## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

-----Example Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We have two students, Ram and Shyam, with roll numbers `A` and `B`. They can only cheat if they receive the same set of questions. The sets of questions are distributed based on the roll number modulo `p`, where `p` is the number of different sets. We need to determine how many values of `p` allow Ram and Shyam to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`. This implies that `A-1` and `B-1` must have the same remainder when divided by `p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p` which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `A - B = k * p`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The above equation implies that `p` must be a divisor of `|A - B|`. Therefore, the number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A - B|`.

4. **Special Case**: If `A == B`, then `A - B = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to an infinite number of solutions. In this case, we return `-1`.

5. **Iterating Over Test Cases**: For each test case, compute `|A - B|` and count its divisors to determine the number of valid `p` values.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_divisors(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve(T, test_cases):
    for each (A, B) in test_cases:
        diff = abs(A - B)
        result = count_divisors(diff)
        print(result)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_divisors(n):
    # If n is zero, it means A and B are equal, leading to infinite solutions
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    count = 0
    # Check divisors up to the square root of n
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            # If i is not the square root of n, count the complement divisor
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        result = count_divisors(diff)
        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

```

This solution reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and outputs the number of valid `p` values for each case. If `A` equals `B`, it outputs `-1` to indicate infinite solutions.

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        ### Step-by-Step Analysis

        1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.

        2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.

        3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.

        4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.

        5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.

        6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.

        7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.

        ### Potential Issues

        - **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.

        ### Correction

        To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.

        ### Corrected Code

        ```python
        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
            factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)

                    else:

        This code should now correctly read input, process each test case, and output the results as expected. The main issue was that the function `solve_queries()` was not being called, which has now been fixed.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of finding subsets where a specific number appears at a specific position in a sorted order, the core concept was understanding combinatorial counting. The problem required calculating the number of ways to choose elements such that a given number `I` appears at position `K` in a sorted subset. This involved using binomial coefficients to count combinations and powers of 2 to account for remaining elements.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Binomial Coefficients**: Used to determine the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` elements.
    - **Powers of 2**: Used to calculate the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I`.
    - **Modulo Arithmetic**: Essential for handling large numbers, as results needed to be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

    ### Strategies:
    - **Precomputation**: Precomputing factorials and their modular inverses was crucial for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.
    - **Efficient Input/Output Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write` helped manage large input and output sizes.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Function Call**: Initially, the function `solve_queries()` was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by explicitly calling the function at the end of the script.
    - **Understanding the Problem**: Ensuring that the logic correctly handled the constraints, such as when `K > I`, was important for producing correct results.

    The experience reinforced the importance of precomputation in combinatorial problems and highlighted the need to ensure that all parts of the code are executed, especially in competitive programming environments where input/output handling is critical.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and each student gets a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers `A` and `B` for Ram and Shyam, we need to find how many values of `p` allow them to get the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This implies that `(A-1) % p` should equal `(B-1) % p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|`.

### Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve(T, test_cases):
    for each (A, B) in test_cases:
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(countDivisors(diff))
```

### Python Code

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, calculates the absolute difference between the roll numbers. It then determines the number of divisors of this difference, which corresponds to the number of valid `p` values. If the difference is zero, it outputs `-1` to indicate infinite solutions.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and each student gets a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers `A` and `B` for Ram and Shyam, we need to find how many values of `p` allow them to get the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This implies that `(A-1) % p` should equal `(B-1) % p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|`.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being read or how the output is being printed. Let's go through the potential issues step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments where input is provided all at once. However, if the environment expects line-by-line input, this could be problematic.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is a common mistake when writing functions for competitive programming problems. The function needs to be explicitly called to execute the logic.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This is correct, but if the function is not called, this part will not execute.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Ensure the `solve()` function is called**: This is crucial to ensure that the logic inside the function is executed.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly. If the environment expects line-by-line input, adjust the input reading method accordingly.

3. **Check Output**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Revised Python Code

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input reading method remains the same, assuming the environment provides input in a single block. If this assumption is incorrect, the input method may need to be adjusted.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now explicitly called, and the input/output handling is correctly set up for a typical competitive programming environment.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and each student gets a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers `A` and `B` for Ram and Shyam, we need to find how many values of `p` allow them to get the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This implies that `(A-1) % p` should equal `(B-1) % p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|`.

### Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve(T, test_cases):
    for each (A, B) in test_cases:
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(countDivisors(diff))
```

### Python Code

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, calculates the absolute difference between the roll numbers. It then determines the number of divisors of this difference, which corresponds to the number of valid `p` values. If the difference is zero, it outputs `-1` to indicate infinite solutions.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being read or how the output is being printed. Let's go through the potential issues step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments where input is provided all at once. However, if the environment expects line-by-line input, this could be problematic.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is a common mistake when writing functions for competitive programming problems. The function needs to be explicitly called to execute the logic.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This is correct, but if the function is not called, this part will not execute.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Ensure the `solve()` function is called**: This is crucial to ensure that the logic inside the function is executed.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly. If the environment expects line-by-line input, adjust the input reading method accordingly.

3. **Check Output**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Revised Python Code

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input reading method remains the same, assuming the environment provides input in a single block. If this assumption is incorrect, the input method may need to be adjusted.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now explicitly called, and the input/output handling is correctly set up for a typical competitive programming environment.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The challenge was to determine the optimal path to minimize the number of operations.

    The core concept here was to leverage the properties of even and odd numbers. For even numbers, dividing by 2 is straightforward and optimal. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, as this would allow for further division by 2 in subsequent steps. A special case was when `n` was `3`, where decrementing to `2` was optimal.

    The solution involved a loop that continued until `n` became `1`, applying the appropriate operation at each step and counting the number of operations. The strategy of checking divisibility by 4 for odd numbers proved effective in minimizing the steps.

    The implementation was straightforward, and the logic was verified by passing the provided test cases. This problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on future outcomes. The solution was efficient and did not encounter any unexpected errors. Here is the final code:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            steps = 0
            while n != 1:
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    n //= 2
                else:
                    if n == 3 or (n & 2) == 0:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        n += 1
                steps += 1
            return steps
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

### Explanation

- **Function `countDivisors(n)`**: This function calculates the number of divisors of a given number `n`. It iterates from `1` to `sqrt(n)` and checks if `i` is a divisor. If it is, it counts both `i` and `n/i` as divisors unless they are the same.

- **Function `solve()`**: This function handles reading input, processing each test case, and printing the results.
  - It reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings.
  - It extracts the number of test cases `T`.
  - For each test case, it reads the roll numbers `A` and `B`, calculates their absolute difference, and determines the number of divisors of this difference.
  - If `A` equals `B`, it appends `-1` to the results list, indicating infinite solutions.
  - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

- **Execution**: The `solve()` function is called at the end to ensure the logic is executed when the script runs. This setup is typical for competitive programming environments where the input is provided via standard input.

### Explanation

- **Function `countDivisors(n)`**: This function calculates the number of divisors of a given number `n`. It iterates from `1` to `sqrt(n)` and checks if `i` is a divisor. If it is, it counts both `i` and `n/i` as divisors unless they are the same.

- **Function `solve()`**: This function handles reading input, processing each test case, and printing the results.
  - It reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings.
  - It extracts the number of test cases `T`.
  - For each test case, it reads the roll numbers `A` and `B`, calculates their absolute difference, and determines the number of divisors of this difference.
  - If `A` equals `B`, it appends `-1` to the results list, indicating infinite solutions.
  - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

- **Execution**: The `solve()` function is called at the end to ensure the logic is executed when the script runs. This setup is typical for competitive programming environments where the input is provided via standard input.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and each student gets a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers `A` and `B` for Ram and Shyam, we need to find how many values of `p` allow them to get the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This implies that `(A-1) % p` should equal `(B-1) % p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|`.

### Pseudocode

```
function countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count

function solve(T, test_cases):
    for each (A, B) in test_cases:
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(countDivisors(diff))
```

### Python Code

```python
def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:

        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, calculates the absolute difference between the roll numbers. It then determines the number of divisors of this difference, which corresponds to the number of valid `p` values. If the difference is zero, it outputs `-1` to indicate infinite solutions.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being read or how the output is being printed. Let's go through the potential issues step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is appropriate for competitive programming environments where input is provided all at once. However, if the environment expects line-by-line input, this could be problematic.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. This is a common mistake when writing functions for competitive programming problems. The function needs to be explicitly called to execute the logic.

3. **Output**: The results are stored in a list and printed at the end. This is correct, but if the function is not called, this part will not execute.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Ensure the `solve()` function is called**: This is crucial to ensure that the logic inside the function is executed.

2. **Verify Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly. If the environment expects line-by-line input, adjust the input reading method accordingly.

3. **Check Output**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Revised Python Code

def countDivisors(n):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
        i += 1
    return count

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        A = int(data[index])
        B = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        diff = abs(A - B)
        if diff == 0:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the logic
solve()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input reading method remains the same, assuming the environment provides input in a single block. If this assumption is incorrect, the input method may need to be adjusted.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now explicitly called, and the input/output handling is correctly set up for a typical competitive programming environment.

- **Function `solve()`**: This function handles reading input, processing each test case, and printing the results.

  - It extracts the number of test cases `T`.
  - For each test case, it reads the roll numbers `A` and `B`, calculates their absolute difference, and determines the number of divisors of this difference.
  - If `A` equals `B`, it appends `-1` to the results list, indicating infinite solutions.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was determining when two students, Ram and Shyam, could receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers and a modulus operation. The key insight was recognizing that they could cheat if the difference between their roll numbers, `|A-B|`, is divisible by `p`. This led to the realization that the number of valid `p` values is equivalent to the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, implying infinite solutions.

Initially, the code failed to produce output because the function containing the logic was not called. This was a simple oversight but a crucial one, highlighting the importance of ensuring that all functions are executed in a script, especially in competitive programming settings where input and output are handled via standard streams.

The solution involved writing a helper function to count divisors and a main function to handle input, process each test case, and output results. The use of `sys.stdin.read()` was appropriate for reading all input at once, which is common in such environments. The experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the utility of mathematical insights in simplifying problem constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Ram and Shyam want to cheat on an exam by getting the same set of questions. The exam board has `p` different sets of questions, and each student gets a set based on their roll number `r` using the formula `((r-1) % p)`. Given the roll numbers `A` and `B` for Ram and Shyam, we need to find how many values of `p` allow them to get the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Condition**: Ram and Shyam can cheat if `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`. This implies that `(A-1) % p` should equal `(B-1) % p`.

2. **Simplifying the Condition**: The condition can be rewritten as `(A-1) % p == (B-1) % p`, which implies `(A-1) - (B-1) = k * p` for some integer `k`. This simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`.

3. **Finding Valid `p` Values**: The number of valid `p` values is the number of divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinitely many solutions.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate `|A-B|`.
   - If `A == B`, output `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - Otherwise, count the divisors of `|A-B|`.

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input reading method remains the same, assuming the environment provides input in a single block. If this assumption is incorrect, the input method may need to be adjusted.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now explicitly called, and the input/output handling is correctly set up for a typical competitive programming environment.

### Explanation

- **Function `countDivisors(n)`**: This function calculates the number of divisors of a given number `n`. It iterates from `1` to `sqrt(n)` and checks if `i` is a divisor. If it is, it counts both `i` and `n/i` as divisors unless they are the same.

- **Function `solve()`**: This function handles reading input, processing each test case, and printing the results.
  - It reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings.
  - It extracts the number of test cases `T`.
  - For each test case, it reads the roll numbers `A` and `B`, calculates their absolute difference, and determines the number of divisors of this difference.
  - If `A` equals `B`, it appends `-1` to the results list, indicating infinite solutions.
  - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

- **Execution**: The `solve()` function is called at the end to ensure the logic is executed when the script runs. This setup is typical for competitive programming environments where the input is provided via standard input.

- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

The problem was a good exercise in understanding modular arithmetic and divisors. The key insight was recognizing that Ram and Shyam can cheat if the difference between their roll numbers is divisible by `p`. This boils down to counting the divisors of the absolute difference `|A-B|`.

#### Key Insights:

1. **Condition Simplification**: The condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)` simplifies to `(A-B) % p == 0`. This means `p` must be a divisor of `|A-B|`.

2. **Handling Special Case**: If `A == B`, then `|A-B| = 0`, and any positive integer `p` will satisfy the condition, leading to infinite solutions. This is handled by checking if `A` and `B` are equal and returning `-1`.

3. **Efficient Divisor Counting**: The solution efficiently counts divisors by iterating up to the square root of the number. For each divisor `i` found, both `i` and `n/i` are counted unless they are the same.

#### Comparison with Official Solution:

- **Efficiency**: Both my solution and the official solution use the same efficient method to count divisors, iterating up to the square root of the difference.
- **Input Handling**: The official solution uses direct input reading and processing within a loop, which is typical for competitive programming. My solution used `sys.stdin.read()` to handle input, which is also common but requires careful handling of input parsing.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Both solutions correctly handle the case where `A == B` by returning `-1`.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of simplifying conditions and efficiently counting divisors, which are common tasks in competitive programming. The official solution was straightforward and aligned well with my approach, confirming the correctness of the logic used.

[Problem]
    Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
    - The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
    - If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
    Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
    You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 100$
    - $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

    -----Example Input-----
    1
    2 6

    -----Example Output-----
    3

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: They can cheat for $p = 1$, $p = 2$ or $p = 4$.
