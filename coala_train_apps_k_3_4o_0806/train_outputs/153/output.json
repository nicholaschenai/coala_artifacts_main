    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if we can use all given matchsticks to form a square. Each matchstick can only be used once, and we cannot break any matchstick. The sum of the lengths of the matchsticks must be divisible by 4 to form a square, as a square has four equal sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   First, check if the total length of all matchsticks is divisible by 4. If not, it's impossible to form a square. If it is, the target length for each side of the square is the total length divided by 4. Sort the matchsticks in descending order to try to fit the largest matchsticks first, which helps in reducing the number of possibilities to check. Use a recursive backtracking approach to try to build each side of the square. If we can successfully build four sides of the target length, return true; otherwise, return false.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function makesquare(nums):\n       if nums is empty or sum of nums is not divisible by 4:\n           return false\n       \n       target = sum of nums divided by 4\n       sort nums in descending order\n       \n       initialize an array sides with four zeros (representing the four sides of the square)\n       \n       function backtrack(index):\n           if index is equal to length of nums:\n               return true if all sides are equal to target\n           \n           for each side in sides:\n               if adding nums[index] to side does not exceed target:\n                   add nums[index] to side\n                   if backtrack(index + 1) is true:\n                       return true\n                   remove nums[index] from side\n           \n           return false\n       \n       return backtrack(0)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def makesquare(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        # If there are no matchsticks or the total length is not divisible by 4, we cannot form a square\n        if not nums or sum(nums) % 4 != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # The target length for each side of the square\n        target = sum(nums) // 4\n        \n        # Sort the matchsticks in descending order to try larger ones first\n        nums.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        # Initialize an array to keep track of the lengths of the four sides\n        sides = [0] * 4\n        \n        # Helper function to attempt to build the square using backtracking\n        def backtrack(index):\n            # If we've placed all matchsticks, check if all sides are equal to the target\n            if index == len(nums):\n                return all(side == target for side in sides)\n            \n            # Try to place the current matchstick in each side\n            for i in range(4):\n                # If adding the current matchstick to this side doesn't exceed the target\n                if sides[i] + nums[index] <= target:\n                    # Place the matchstick\n                    sides[i] += nums[index]\n                    # Recursively attempt to place the next matchstick\n                    if backtrack(index + 1):\n                        return True\n                    # Remove the matchstick (backtrack)\n                    sides[i] -= nums[index]\n            \n            # If no valid placement was found, return False\n            return False\n        \n        # Start the backtracking process from the first matchstick\n        return backtrack(0)\n```\n\nThis solution uses a backtracking approach to explore all possible ways to form a square with the given matchsticks, ensuring that each matchstick is used exactly once.",
