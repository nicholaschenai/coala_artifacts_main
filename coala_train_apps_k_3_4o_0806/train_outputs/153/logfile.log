INFO - [Task id] 153 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

The problem is to determine if a given list of matchstick lengths can be used to form a square. Each matchstick must be used exactly once, and you cannot break any matchstick. The goal is to see if you can arrange the matchsticks such that they form a square with equal side lengths.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Check Total Length**: First, calculate the total length of all matchsticks. If this total is not divisible by 4, it's impossible to form a square, so return `False`.

2. **Determine Side Length**: If the total length is divisible by 4, then each side of the square must be equal to `total_length / 4`.

3. **Backtracking Approach**: Use a backtracking approach to try and form the square. Start by sorting the matchsticks in descending order to optimize the process (larger sticks are harder to place, so try them first).

4. **Recursive Function**: Create a recursive function that attempts to place each matchstick into one of the four sides. If a matchstick can fit into a side without exceeding the target side length, place it there and move to the next matchstick.

5. **Base Case**: If all matchsticks are placed successfully, return `True`. If you cannot place a matchstick in any side without exceeding the target length, backtrack and try a different configuration.

6. **Pruning**: If at any point a side becomes exactly equal to the target side length, move to the next side.

## Pseudocode

```
function makesquare(nums):
    if nums is empty or sum(nums) % 4 != 0:
        return False
    
    target_side_length = sum(nums) / 4
    sort nums in descending order
    
    initialize sides as [0, 0, 0, 0]
    
    function canFormSquare(index):
        if index == length of nums:
            return all sides are equal to target_side_length
        
        for each side in sides:
            if side + nums[index] <= target_side_length:
                add nums[index] to side
                if canFormSquare(index + 1):
                    return True
                remove nums[index] from side
            if side is 0:
                break
        
        return False
    
    return canFormSquare(0)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def makesquare(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        # If there are no matchsticks, we cannot form a square
        if not nums:
            return False
        
        # Calculate the total length of all matchsticks
        total_length = sum(nums)
        
        # If the total length is not divisible by 4, we cannot form a square
        if total_length % 4 != 0:
            return False
        
        # Each side of the square must be of this length
        target_side_length = total_length // 4
        
        # Sort the matchsticks in descending order
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Initialize the four sides of the square
        sides = [0] * 4
        
        # Helper function to attempt to form the square
        def canFormSquare(index):
            # If we've placed all matchsticks, check if all sides are equal to target
            if index == len(nums):
                return all(side == target_side_length for side in sides)
            
            # Try to place the current matchstick in each side
            for i in range(4):
                if sides[i] + nums[index] <= target_side_length:
                    sides[i] += nums[index]
                    if canFormSquare(index + 1):
                        return True
                    sides[i] -= nums[index]
                
                # If a side is 0, no need to try other sides as they are also 0
                if sides[i] == 0:
                    break
            
            return False
        
        # Start the recursive backtracking from the first matchstick
        return canFormSquare(0)
```

This solution uses a backtracking approach to try and fit each matchstick into one of the four sides of the square, ensuring that each side does not exceed the target side length. The matchsticks are sorted in descending order to optimize the placement process.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element.

    This approach efficiently computes the LIS length in O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable given the problem constraints. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence problems and provided a clear example of how to implement it effectively.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest subsequence where each number is greater than the previous one. The subsequence does not need to be contiguous, and we are only interested in the length of this subsequence.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We'll maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We initialize each `d[i]` to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element, we check all previous elements to see if they can be part of an increasing subsequence ending at the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `d` array.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function lengthOfLIS(nums):
               if nums is empty:
                   return 0
       
               n = length of nums
               d = array of size n, initialized to 1
       
               for i from 1 to n-1:
                   for j from 0 to i-1:
                       if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                           d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
       
               return max value in d
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                # If the input list is empty, the longest increasing subsequence is 0
                if not nums:
                    return 0
        
                # Initialize the dynamic programming array with 1s
                # Each element is at least an increasing subsequence of length 1 (itself)
                n = len(nums)
                d = [1] * n
        
                # Iterate over each element in the list
                for i in range(1, n):
                    # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence
                    for j in range(i):
                        # If the current element is greater than a previous element
                        if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                            # Update the dp array to reflect the longest subsequence ending at i
                            d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
                # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the dp array
                return max(d)
        ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to achieve an O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable for the problem constraints.

[Reflection]:
    The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. My initial approach used a dynamic programming array to track possible sums, which is a common technique for partition problems.

    The official solution, however, uses a set to track possible sums, which is a more elegant and concise approach. Here's a breakdown of the official solution:

    1. **Initialization**: Start with a set `dp` containing only the sum `0`. This set will be used to track all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones.

    2. **Iterate through stones**: For each stone, update the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in `dp`. This is done using set comprehension, which efficiently updates the set with new possible sums.

    3. **Calculate the result**: After processing all stones, the set `dp` contains all possible sums. The goal is to find the sum that, when doubled and subtracted from the total weight, gives the smallest possible result. This is achieved by iterating through the set and calculating the minimum of `abs(total - 2 * _sum)` for each `_sum` in `dp`.

    The official solution is insightful because it leverages Python's set operations to efficiently manage and update possible sums, resulting in a more concise and potentially faster implementation compared to the traditional dynamic programming array approach. This solution is particularly elegant in its use of set comprehension to handle the sum updates in a single line, making the code both compact and easy to understand.

INFO - [Task id] 153 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine if we can use all given matchsticks to form a square. Each matchstick can only be used once, and we cannot break any matchstick. The sum of the lengths of the matchsticks must be divisible by 4 to form a square, as a square has four equal sides.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   First, check if the total length of all matchsticks is divisible by 4. If not, it's impossible to form a square. If it is, the target length for each side of the square is the total length divided by 4. Sort the matchsticks in descending order to try to fit the largest matchsticks first, which helps in reducing the number of possibilities to check. Use a recursive backtracking approach to try to build each side of the square. If we can successfully build four sides of the target length, return true; otherwise, return false.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function makesquare(nums):
       if nums is empty or sum of nums is not divisible by 4:
           return false
       
       target = sum of nums divided by 4
       sort nums in descending order
       
       initialize an array sides with four zeros (representing the four sides of the square)
       
       function backtrack(index):
           if index is equal to length of nums:
               return true if all sides are equal to target

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine if we can use all given matchsticks to form a square. Each matchstick can only be used once, and we cannot break any matchstick. The sum of the lengths of the matchsticks must be divisible by 4 to form a square, as a square has four equal sides.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   First, check if the total length of all matchsticks is divisible by 4. If not, it's impossible to form a square. If it is, the target length for each side of the square is the total length divided by 4. Sort the matchsticks in descending order to try to fit the largest matchsticks first, which helps in reducing the number of possibilities to check. Use a recursive backtracking approach to try to build each side of the square. If we can successfully build four sides of the target length, return true; otherwise, return false.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function makesquare(nums):
       if nums is empty or sum of nums is not divisible by 4:
           return false
       
       target = sum of nums divided by 4
       sort nums in descending order
       
       initialize an array sides with four zeros (representing the four sides of the square)
       
       function backtrack(index):
           if index is equal to length of nums:
               return true if all sides are equal to target

               if adding nums[index] to side does not exceed target:
                   add nums[index] to side

## Instructions
Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 153 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine if a set of matchsticks could be used to form a square, with each matchstick used exactly once. The core concept here is to check if the total length of the matchsticks is divisible by 4, as a square has four equal sides. If not, forming a square is impossible.

The strategy that worked involved sorting the matchsticks in descending order and using a backtracking approach to try to build each side of the square. Sorting helps in reducing the number of possibilities to check by attempting to fit the largest matchsticks first. The backtracking function recursively attempts to place each matchstick into one of the four sides, ensuring that no side exceeds the target length (total length divided by 4).

This approach was effective because it systematically explores all possible configurations while pruning paths that exceed the target length early on. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency for the given constraints. The key takeaway is the use of backtracking combined with sorting to efficiently solve combinatorial problems involving partitioning into equal subsets.

INFO - [Task id] 153 [generation text] The problem of forming a square using matchsticks is a classic example of a combinatorial problem that can be effectively solved using backtracking. My initial approach was similar to the official solution in terms of using backtracking, but there are some differences in implementation details and optimizations.

### Key Insights:

1. **Divisibility Check**: Both solutions start by checking if the total length of matchsticks is divisible by 4. This is a necessary condition for forming a square, as each side must be of equal length.

2. **Sorting for Optimization**: Sorting the matchsticks in descending order is a crucial step. It helps in reducing the number of recursive calls by attempting to fit larger matchsticks first, which can quickly lead to dead ends if a solution is not possible.

3. **Backtracking Approach**: Both solutions use a backtracking approach to explore possible combinations of matchsticks to form the sides of the square. The official solution uses an iterative approach with a stack to manage the state, while my solution uses a recursive function.

4. **State Management**: The official solution uses a set to keep track of used indices and a stack to manage the state of the search, including the current target for a side and the remaining rounds (sides) to complete. This is a more explicit way of managing state compared to the recursive approach.

5. **Efficiency Considerations**: The official solution includes additional checks, such as ensuring the largest matchstick is not greater than the target side length, which can immediately rule out impossible cases.

### Reflection:

The official solution provides a more explicit and iterative approach to the problem, which can be easier to follow and debug compared to a recursive approach. The use of a stack to manage state and the explicit handling of used indices are insightful techniques that can be applied to other combinatorial problems. Additionally, the solution's structure allows for easy insertion of print statements for debugging, which can be beneficial during development.

Overall, both solutions are effective, but the official solution's iterative approach and explicit state management offer a different perspective that can be useful in scenarios where recursion depth is a concern or when debugging complex state transitions.

[Problem]
    Remember the story of Little Match Girl? By now, you know exactly what matchsticks the little match girl has, please find out a way you can make one square by using up all those matchsticks. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.

     Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their stick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether you could make one square using all the matchsticks the little match girl has.

    Example 1:

    Input: [1,1,2,2,2]
    Output: true

    Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came two sticks with length 1.



    Example 2:

    Input: [3,3,3,3,4]
    Output: false

    Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.



    Note:

    The length sum of the given matchsticks is in the range of 0 to 10^9.
