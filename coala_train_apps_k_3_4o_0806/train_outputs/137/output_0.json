    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to transform a given integer `n` into `0` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:\n   - Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of `n`.\n   - Change the `i-th` bit if the `(i-1)th` bit is set to `1` and all bits from `0` to `(i-2)` are `0`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The problem can be approached by understanding the binary representation of `n`. The operations allowed are essentially toggling bits under specific conditions. The key is to determine the minimum number of such toggles required to turn all bits to `0`. This can be achieved by recursively calculating the number of operations needed for each bit, starting from the most significant bit down to the least significant bit.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function minimumOneBitOperations(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 0\n       find the most significant bit position of n\n       return 2^(position+1) - 1 - minimumOneBitOperations(n XOR (1 << position))\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n        # Helper function to calculate the minimum operations recursively\n        def helper(n):\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n            # Find the most significant bit position\n            msb = 0\n            while (1 << msb) <= n:\n                msb += 1\n            msb -= 1\n            # Calculate the number of operations using the formula\n            return (1 << (msb + 1)) - 1 - helper(n ^ (1 << msb))\n        \n        # Call the helper function with the initial value of n\n        return helper(n)\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive approach to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to transform `n` into `0`. The key insight is to use the properties of binary numbers and the allowed operations to derive a formula that calculates the number of operations based on the most significant bit.",
