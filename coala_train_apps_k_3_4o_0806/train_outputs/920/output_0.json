    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nYou are given a string representing a line of students, where each character is either 'b' (boy) or 'g' (girl). The awkwardness of the line is defined as the sum of pairwise distances between each boy and girl. The task is to reorder the students to minimize this awkwardness. You need to determine the minimum possible awkwardness for each test case.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Awkwardness**: The awkwardness is the sum of distances between every boy and every girl. To minimize this, we should aim to place all boys together and all girls together, minimizing the distance between different groups.\n\n2. **Optimal Arrangement**: The optimal arrangement is to have all boys on one side and all girls on the other side. This way, the distance between any boy and any girl is minimized to the difference in their group sizes.\n\n3. **Calculate Minimum Awkwardness**: \n   - Count the number of boys (`b_count`) and girls (`g_count`).\n   - The minimum awkwardness is achieved when all boys are together and all girls are together, which is `b_count * g_count`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    b_count = count 'b' in s\n    g_count = count 'g' in s\n    return b_count * g_count\n\nfunction main():\n    read T\n    for each test case:\n        read string s\n        result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n        print result\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    # Count the number of boys and girls\n    b_count = s.count('b')\n    g_count = s.count('g')\n    # The minimum awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and girls\n    return b_count * g_count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each test case\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        s = data[i]\n        result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Function `calculate_minimum_awkwardness`**: This function calculates the minimum awkwardness by counting the number of boys and girls in the string and returning their product.\n- **Function `main`**: This function handles input and output. It reads all input at once, processes each test case, and prints the results.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using simple counting and arithmetic operations, ensuring it runs within time limits for large inputs.",
