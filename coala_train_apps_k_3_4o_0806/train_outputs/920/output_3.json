    "raw_msg": "Let's address the issue with the previous solution. The problem is to minimize the awkwardness by rearranging the students such that all boys are together and all girls are together. The awkwardness is calculated as the sum of pairwise distances between each boy and each girl.\n\nThe correct approach is to calculate the minimum awkwardness by multiplying the number of boys by the number of girls, as this represents the sum of distances when all boys are on one side and all girls on the other.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    # Count the number of boys and girls\n    b_count = s.count('b')\n    g_count = s.count('g')\n    # The minimum awkwardness is the product of the number of boys and girls\n    return b_count * g_count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read number of test cases\n    T = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each test case\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        s = data[i]\n        result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Output all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Counting Boys and Girls**: We count the number of 'b' and 'g' in the string to determine how many boys and girls are present.\n- **Awkwardness Calculation**: The minimum awkwardness is calculated as the product of the number of boys and the number of girls, which represents the sum of distances when all boys are together and all girls are together.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the constraints by using simple counting and arithmetic operations, ensuring it runs within time limits for large inputs.",
