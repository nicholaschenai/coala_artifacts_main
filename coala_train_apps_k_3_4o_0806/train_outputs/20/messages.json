The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.\n\nGildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.\n\nGiven the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $-10^9 \\le m \\le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.\n\nNext, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$, $-10^9 \\le l_i \\le h_i \\le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.\n\nThe customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n3 0\n5 1 2\n7 3 5\n10 -1 0\n2 12\n5 7 10\n10 16 20\n3 -100\n100 0 0\n100 -50 50\n200 100 100\n1 100\n99 -100 0\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. \n\nIn the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.\n\nIn the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The restaurant's air conditioner can heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. Each customer has a specific time they visit and a temperature range they prefer. We need to check if we can adjust the temperature to be within each customer's preferred range at their visit time.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature and time at 0.\n2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the previous customer (or from time 0 for the first customer).\n3. **Temperature Range Calculation**: Determine the possible temperature range at the customer's visit time by considering the time difference and the ability to change the temperature by 1 degree per minute.\n4. **Check Satisfaction**: For each customer, check if their preferred temperature range overlaps with the possible temperature range at their visit time.\n5. **Update Temperature Range**: Adjust the possible temperature range for the next customer based on the current customer's constraints.\n6. **Output Result**: If all customers can be satisfied, output \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\".\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read n, m\n        current_time = 0\n        min_temp = max_temp = m\n        \n        for each customer:\n            read t_i, l_i, h_i\n            time_diff = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update possible temperature range\n            min_temp -= time_diff\n            max_temp += time_diff\n            \n            # Check if the customer's range is satisfiable\n            if max_temp < l_i or min_temp > h_i:\n                print \"NO\"\n                break\n            \n            # Update the possible range for the next customer\n            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # Update current time\n            current_time = t_i\n        else:\n            print \"YES\"\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        n, m = test_case[0]\n        customers = test_case[1]\n        \n        current_time = 0\n        min_temp = max_temp = m\n        \n        possible = True\n        for t_i, l_i, h_i in customers:\n            time_diff = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update possible temperature range\n            min_temp -= time_diff\n            max_temp += time_diff\n            \n            # Check if the customer's range is satisfiable\n            if max_temp < l_i or min_temp > h_i:\n                possible = False\n                break\n            \n            # Update the possible range for the next customer\n            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # Update current time\n            current_time = t_i\n        \n        if possible:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n    return results\n\n# Example usage:\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nindex = 0\nq = int(data[index])\nindex += 1\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(q):\n    n, m = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n    index += 2\n    customers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        t_i, l_i, h_i = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2])\n        index += 3\n        customers.append((t_i, l_i, h_i))\n    test_cases.append(((n, m), customers))\n\n# Get results\nresults = can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if all customers can be satisfied by adjusting the temperature within their preferred ranges. It outputs \"YES\" or \"NO\" for each test case."

The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Yesterday, Chef found $K$ empty boxes in the cooler and decided to fill them with apples. He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. \n        Only two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.\n        Chef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?\n        Note: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n        - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. \n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, print a single line containing the string \"YES\" if the final distributions of apples can be different or \"NO\" if they will be the same (without quotes).\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $1 \\le T \\le 250$\n        - $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^{18}$\n        - $N$ is divisible by $K$\n\n        -----Subtasks-----\n        Subtask #1 (30 points): $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^5$\n        Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n        -----Example Input-----\n        3\n        5 1\n        4 2\n        10 10\n\n        -----Example Output-----\n        NO\n        NO\n        YES\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        Example case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.\n        Example case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.\n        Example case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be $10$ apples in one box and none in all other boxes.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ### Problem Restatement\n\n        Chef has two candidates to distribute apples into boxes. Each candidate distributes apples differently:\n        - The first candidate distributes apples evenly, putting one apple in each box at a time.\n        - The second candidate puts all apples into the box with the fewest apples.\n\n        Given the number of apples \\( N \\) and the number of boxes \\( K \\), determine if the final distribution of apples can differ based on which candidate is hired.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Distribution**:\n           - The first candidate will always distribute apples evenly across all boxes. If \\( N \\) is divisible by \\( K \\), each box will have \\( \\frac{N}{K} \\) apples.\n           - The second candidate will put all apples into one box, resulting in one box having all \\( N \\) apples and the rest having zero.\n\n        2. **Determine if Distributions Can Differ**:\n           - If \\( K = 1 \\), both candidates will result in the same distribution since there's only one box.\n           - If \\( K > 1 \\), the distributions will differ because the first candidate will distribute apples evenly, while the second will concentrate all apples in one box.\n\n        3. **Output**:\n           - For each test case, output \"YES\" if the distributions can differ, otherwise \"NO\".\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function can_distributions_differ(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N, K = test_case\n                if K == 1:\n                    print \"NO\"\n                else:\n                    print \"YES\"\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def can_distributions_differ(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for N, K in test_cases:\n                if K == 1:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"YES\")\n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n                index += 2\n                test_cases.append((N, K))\n    \n            can_distributions_differ(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        This code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, checks if the number of boxes \\( K \\) is greater than 1. If so, it outputs \"YES\" indicating that the distributions can differ; otherwise, it outputs \"NO\".\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['3', '5 1', '4 2', '10 10'] Output: [{'NO'}, {'NO'}, {'YES'}]\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.

This assumption is flawed because it doesn't account for the individual adjustments needed for each element.\n\n        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n        1. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The solution assumes that divisibility by the sum of indices is sufficient to determine if the sequence can be made to sum to zero. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the specific adjustments needed for each element.\n\n        2. **Incorrect Feasibility Check**: The check for whether each element can be adjusted by `k` operations is not correctly implemented. The logic should ensure that the cumulative adjustments can lead to a zero sum, not just individual feasibility.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        1. **Cumulative Adjustment Simulation**: We need to simulate the process of adjusting each element by its index and ensure that the cumulative effect can lead to a zero sum.\n\n        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:\n\n        - Start with the sum of the sequence.\n        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.\n        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return \"NO\".\n        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return \"YES\".\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                # We need to check if we can make the sum of A equal to zero\n                # by reducing it by multiples of the sum of indices (1 to N)\n                if sum_A % required_sum == 0:\n                    # Calculate how many times we need to perform the operation\n                    k = sum_A // required_sum\n                    # Check if we can distribute k operations across the sequence\n                    possible = True\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        # Calculate the required change for A[i]\n                        change = A[i] - (k * (i + 1))\n                        if change < 0:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n            \n                    if possible:\n                        results.append(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n        - **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices (1 to N).\n        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices.

If any element cannot be adjusted properly, it's impossible to make the sequence sum to zero.\n        - **Output**: Append \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the results based on the feasibility check and print the results.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Let's address the problem with a fresh approach. The key is to simulate the process of adjusting the sequence to make the sum zero by using the allowed operations effectively.\n\n        ### Correct Approach\n\n        1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.\n\n        2. **Key Insight**: The sum of the sequence can be adjusted by reducing each element by its index. The problem boils down to checking if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by these operations.\n\n        3. **Solution Strategy**:\n           - Calculate the sum of the sequence.\n           - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.\n           - Check if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by iteratively applying the operations.\n\n        ### Revised Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N = test_case[0]\n                A = test_case[1]\n        \n                sum_A = sum(A)\n                required_sum = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Sum of first N natural numbers\n        \n                # We need to check if we can make the sum of A equal to zero\n                # by reducing it by multiples of the sum of indices (1 to N)\n                if sum_A % required_sum == 0:\n                    # Calculate how many times we need to perform the operation\n                    k = sum_A // required_sum\n                    # Check if we can distribute k operations across the sequence\n                    possible = True\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        # Calculate the required change for A[i]\n                        change = A[i] - (k * (i + 1))\n                        if change < 0:\n                            possible = False\n                            break\n            \n                    if possible:\n                        results.append(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        results.append(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"NO\")\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            test_cases = []\n    \n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                index += 1\n                A = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                test_cases.append((N, A))\n    \n            is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n\n        if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n            main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Corrected Code\n\n        - **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of the sequence and the sum of indices (1 to N).\n        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices.

Both approaches focused on maintaining a feasible temperature range that could satisfy each customer as they arrived. Here are some key insights and reflections from the problem-solving process:\n\n1. **Temperature Range Management**: Both solutions effectively manage a range of possible temperatures (`min_temp` and `max_temp`) that can be achieved by the time each customer arrives. This is crucial because it allows us to determine if the current temperature can be adjusted to meet the next customer's requirements.\n\n2. **Time Difference Calculation**: The solutions calculate the time difference between the current time and the next customer's arrival time. This time difference is used to adjust the possible temperature range, considering the air conditioner's ability to heat or cool the restaurant.\n\n3. **Feasibility Check**: Both solutions include a check to see if the adjusted temperature range overlaps with the customer's preferred range. If not, it's impossible to satisfy that customer, and the solution outputs \"NO\".\n\n4. **Iterative Update**: After checking each customer, the solutions update the current time and the feasible temperature range for the next iteration.

Each test case consists of an initial temperature and a list of customers, each with a time and a temperature range they require. It processes each test case to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature over time to satisfy all customers' requirements. For each test case, it calculates the possible temperature range at each customer's time and checks if the range can accommodate the customer's requirements.

It is particularly relevant in scheduling problems where resources (like an air conditioner) must be managed to satisfy a series of conditions or preferences. This problem also illustrates how to handle ranges and constraints dynamically, making it applicable to any situation where you need to ensure a variable stays within certain bounds over time, such as in logistics, operations management, or automated control systems."
