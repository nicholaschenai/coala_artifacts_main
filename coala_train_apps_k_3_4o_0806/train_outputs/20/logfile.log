## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature of a restaurant to satisfy all customers based on their preferred temperature ranges at specific times. The restaurant's air conditioner can heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. Each customer has a specific time they visit and a temperature range they prefer. We need to check if we can adjust the temperature to be within each customer's preferred range at their visit time.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature and time at 0.
2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the previous customer (or from time 0 for the first customer).
3. **Temperature Range Calculation**: Determine the possible temperature range at the customer's visit time by considering the time difference and the ability to change the temperature by 1 degree per minute.
4. **Check Satisfaction**: For each customer, check if their preferred temperature range overlaps with the possible temperature range at their visit time.
5. **Update Temperature Range**: Adjust the possible temperature range for the next customer based on the current customer's constraints.
6. **Output Result**: If all customers can be satisfied, output "YES", otherwise "NO".

## Pseudocode

```
function can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read n, m
        current_time = 0
        min_temp = max_temp = m
        
        for each customer:
            read t_i, l_i, h_i
            time_diff = t_i - current_time
            
            # Update possible temperature range
            min_temp -= time_diff
            max_temp += time_diff
            
            # Check if the customer's range is satisfiable
            if max_temp < l_i or min_temp > h_i:
                print "NO"
                break
            
            # Update the possible range for the next customer
            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)
            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)
            
            # Update current time
            current_time = t_i
        else:
            print "YES"
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, m = test_case[0]
        customers = test_case[1]
        
        current_time = 0
        min_temp = max_temp = m
        
        possible = True
        for t_i, l_i, h_i in customers:
            time_diff = t_i - current_time
            
            # Update possible temperature range
            min_temp -= time_diff
            max_temp += time_diff
            
            # Check if the customer's range is satisfiable
            if max_temp < l_i or min_temp > h_i:
                possible = False
                break
            
            # Update the possible range for the next customer
            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)
            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)
            
            # Update current time
            current_time = t_i
        
        if possible:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
index = 0
q = int(data[index])
index += 1
test_cases = []

for _ in range(q):
    n, m = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    customers = []
    for _ in range(n):
        t_i, l_i, h_i = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        customers.append((t_i, l_i, h_i))
    test_cases.append(((n, m), customers))

# Get results
results = can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and checks if all customers can be satisfied by adjusting the temperature within their preferred ranges. It outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.
[/Summary]


[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Yesterday, Chef found $K$ empty boxes in the cooler and decided to fill them with apples. He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. 
        Only two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.
        Chef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?
        Note: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. 

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the final distributions of apples can be different or "NO" if they will be the same (without quotes).

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \le T \le 250$
        - $1 \le N, K \le 10^{18}$
        - $N$ is divisible by $K$

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask #1 (30 points): $1 \le N, K \le 10^5$
        Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

        -----Example Input-----
        3
        5 1
        4 2
        10 10

        -----Example Output-----
        NO
        NO
        YES

        -----Explanation-----

        ### Problem Restatement

        Chef has two candidates to distribute apples into boxes. Each candidate distributes apples differently:
        - The first candidate distributes apples evenly, putting one apple in each box at a time.
        - The second candidate puts all apples into the box with the fewest apples.

        Given the number of apples \( N \) and the number of boxes \( K \), determine if the final distribution of apples can differ based on which candidate is hired.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Distribution**:
           - The first candidate will always distribute apples evenly across all boxes. If \( N \) is divisible by \( K \), each box will have \( \frac{N}{K} \) apples.
           - The second candidate will put all apples into one box, resulting in one box having all \( N \) apples and the rest having zero.

        2. **Determine if Distributions Can Differ**:
           - If \( K = 1 \), both candidates will result in the same distribution since there's only one box.
           - If \( K > 1 \), the distributions will differ because the first candidate will distribute apples evenly, while the second will concentrate all apples in one box.

        3. **Output**:
           - For each test case, output "YES" if the distributions can differ, otherwise "NO".

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function can_distributions_differ(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, K = test_case
                if K == 1:
                    print "NO"
                else:
                    print "YES"
        ```

        ### Final Python Code

        ```python
        def can_distributions_differ(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for N, K in test_cases:
                if K == 1:
                    results.append("NO")
                else:
                    results.append("YES")
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            test_cases = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
                index += 2
                test_cases.append((N, K))
    
            can_distributions_differ(T, test_cases)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        This code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, checks if the number of boxes \( K \) is greater than 1. If so, it outputs "YES" indicating that the distributions can differ; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \le T \le 1,000$
        - $1 \le N \le 10$
        - $|A_i| \le 100$ for each valid $i$

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask #1 (10 points): $N = 1$
        Subtask #2 (30 points): $N \le 2$

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The current solution is still not correctly addressing the problem because it incorrectly assumes that if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices, then the sequence can be made to sum to zero. This assumption is flawed because it doesn't account for the individual adjustments needed for each element.

        ### Where the Solution Went Wrong

        1. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The solution assumes that divisibility by the sum of indices is sufficient to determine if the sequence can be made to sum to zero. This is incorrect because it doesn't consider the specific adjustments needed for each element.

        2. **Incorrect Feasibility Check**: The check for whether each element can be adjusted by `k` operations is not correctly implemented. The logic should ensure that the cumulative adjustments can lead to a zero sum, not just individual feasibility.

        ### Correct Approach

        1. **Cumulative Adjustment Simulation**: We need to simulate the process of adjusting each element by its index and ensure that the cumulative effect can lead to a zero sum.

        2. **Iterative Adjustment**: Start with the sum of the sequence and iteratively adjust each element by its index, checking if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

        ### Revised Solution

        The correct approach involves iterating over the sequence and simulating the adjustment process:

        - Start with the sum of the sequence.
        - For each element, check if it can be adjusted to contribute to making the sum zero.
        - If at any point the required adjustment is not possible, return "NO".
        - If the entire sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero, return "YES".

        - **Divisibility Check**: We check if the sum of the sequence is divisible by the sum of indices. If not, it's impossible to make the sequence sum to zero.
        - **Operation Count**: If divisible, calculate how many times we need to perform the operation (`k`).
        - **Feasibility Check**: For each element, check if it can be adjusted by `k` operations without going negative. If any element cannot be adjusted properly, it's impossible to make the sequence sum to zero.
        - **Output**: Append "YES" or "NO" to the results based on the feasibility check and print the results.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's address the problem with a fresh approach. The key is to simulate the process of adjusting the sequence to make the sum zero by using the allowed operations effectively.

        ### Correct Approach

        1. **Understanding the Operation**: For each element `A[i]`, we can decrease it by `i` any number of times. This means we can effectively reduce `A[i]` by any multiple of `i`.

        2. **Key Insight**: The sum of the sequence can be adjusted by reducing each element by its index. The problem boils down to checking if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by these operations.

        3. **Solution Strategy**:
           - Calculate the sum of the sequence.
           - Calculate the sum of indices from `1` to `N`.
           - Check if the sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero by iteratively applying the operations.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Gildong owns a restaurant and wants to satisfy all customers by adjusting the restaurant's temperature to their preferred range at the time they visit. The air conditioner can heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. Given the initial temperature and each customer's visit time and preferred temperature range, determine if it's possible to satisfy all customers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature and time at 0.
2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the previous customer (or from time 0 for the first customer).
3. **Temperature Range Calculation**:
   - Calculate the possible temperature range at the current customer's visit time by considering the maximum and minimum temperature changes possible within the time difference.
   - Update the possible temperature range to ensure it overlaps with the customer's preferred range.
4. **Feasibility Check**: If at any point the possible temperature range does not overlap with the customer's preferred range, it's impossible to satisfy all customers.
5. **Output**: If all customers can be satisfied, output "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Explanation

- **Initial Temperature Range**: Start with the initial temperature as both the minimum and maximum possible temperature.
- **Time Difference**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the last customer to determine how much the temperature can change.
- **Adjust Temperature Range**: Update the possible temperature range based on the time difference and ensure it fits within the customer's preferred range.
- **Check Feasibility**: If the possible temperature range does not overlap with the customer's preferred range, output "NO". Otherwise, continue to the next customer.
- **Output Results**: After processing all customers, output "YES" if all can be satisfied, otherwise "NO".

 ### Problem Restatement

Gildong owns a restaurant and wants to satisfy all customers by adjusting the restaurant's temperature to their preferred range at the time they visit. The air conditioner can heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. Given the initial temperature and each customer's visit time and preferred temperature range, determine if it's possible to satisfy all customers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature and time at 0.
2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the previous customer (or from time 0 for the first customer).
3. **Temperature Range Calculation**:
   - Calculate the possible temperature range at the current customer's visit time by considering the maximum and minimum temperature changes possible within the time difference.
   - Update the possible temperature range to ensure it overlaps with the customer's preferred range.
4. **Feasibility Check**: If at any point the possible temperature range does not overlap with the customer's preferred range, it's impossible to satisfy all customers.
5. **Output**: If all customers can be satisfied, output "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read n, m
        current_time = 0
        min_temp = max_temp = m
        
        for each customer (t_i, l_i, h_i):
            time_diff = t_i - current_time
            min_temp -= time_diff
            max_temp += time_diff
            
            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)
            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)
            
            if min_temp > max_temp:
                print "NO"
                break
            current_time = t_i

### Explanation

- **Initial Temperature Range**: Start with the initial temperature as both the minimum and maximum possible temperature.
- **Time Difference**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the last customer to determine how much the temperature can change.
- **Adjust Temperature Range**: Update the possible temperature range based on the time difference and ensure it fits within the customer's preferred range.
- **Check Feasibility**: If the possible temperature range does not overlap with the customer's preferred range, output "NO". Otherwise, continue to the next customer.
- **Output Results**: After processing all customers, output "YES" if all can be satisfied, otherwise "NO".

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept was to manage a dynamic temperature range to satisfy customer preferences at specific times. The challenge was to ensure that the temperature could be adjusted within the constraints of time and customer preferences.

### Key Concepts:
- **Dynamic Range Management**: The solution required maintaining a possible temperature range that could be adjusted based on the time elapsed and the customer's preferred range.
- **Time Difference Calculation**: For each customer, the time difference from the previous customer was crucial to determine how much the temperature could change.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature as both the minimum and maximum possible temperature.
2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference and adjust the possible temperature range accordingly.
3. **Range Adjustment**: Ensure the possible temperature range fits within the customer's preferred range.
4. **Feasibility Check**: If the possible range does not overlap with the customer's range, output "NO". Otherwise, continue.

### Code Snippet:
```python
def can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, m = test_case[0]
        customers = test_case[1]

        min_temp = max_temp = m
        
        possible = True
        for t_i, l_i, h_i in customers:
            time_diff = t_i - current_time
            min_temp -= time_diff
            max_temp += time_diff
            
            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)
            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)
            
            if min_temp > max_temp:
                possible = False
                break
            
            current_time = t_i
        
        if possible:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
```

This problem reinforced the importance of managing state changes over time and ensuring constraints are met dynamically. The approach of maintaining a feasible range and adjusting it based on constraints is a useful pattern for similar problems.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 20 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Gildong owns a restaurant and wants to satisfy all customers by adjusting the restaurant's temperature to their preferred range at the time they visit. The air conditioner can heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. Given the initial temperature and each customer's visit time and preferred temperature range, determine if it's possible to satisfy all customers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the initial temperature and time at 0.
2. **Iterate Over Customers**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the previous customer (or from time 0 for the first customer).
3. **Temperature Range Calculation**:
   - Calculate the possible temperature range at the current customer's visit time by considering the maximum and minimum temperature changes possible within the time difference.
   - Update the possible temperature range to ensure it overlaps with the customer's preferred range.
4. **Feasibility Check**: If at any point the possible temperature range does not overlap with the customer's preferred range, it's impossible to satisfy all customers.
5. **Output**: If all customers can be satisfied, output "YES", otherwise "NO".

### Pseudocode

```
function can_satisfy_all_customers(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read n, m
        current_time = 0
        min_temp = max_temp = m
        
        for each customer (t_i, l_i, h_i):
            time_diff = t_i - current_time
            min_temp -= time_diff
            max_temp += time_diff
            
            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)
            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)
            
            if min_temp > max_temp:
                print "NO"
                break
            current_time = t_i
        else:
            print "YES"

### Explanation

- **Initial Temperature Range**: Start with the initial temperature as both the minimum and maximum possible temperature.
- **Time Difference**: For each customer, calculate the time difference from the last customer to determine how much the temperature can change.
- **Adjust Temperature Range**: Update the possible temperature range based on the time difference and ensure it fits within the customer's preferred range.
- **Check Feasibility**: If the possible temperature range does not overlap with the customer's preferred range, output "NO". Otherwise, continue to the next customer.
- **Output Results**: After processing all customers, output "YES" if all can be satisfied, otherwise "NO".

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] The problem was straightforward, and my solution aligned well with the official solution. Both approaches focused on maintaining a feasible temperature range that could satisfy each customer as they arrived. Here are some key insights and reflections from the problem-solving process:

1. **Temperature Range Management**: Both solutions effectively manage a range of possible temperatures (`min_temp` and `max_temp`) that can be achieved by the time each customer arrives. This is crucial because it allows us to determine if the current temperature can be adjusted to meet the next customer's requirements.

2. **Time Difference Calculation**: The solutions calculate the time difference between the current time and the next customer's arrival time. This time difference is used to adjust the possible temperature range, considering the air conditioner's ability to heat or cool the restaurant.

3. **Feasibility Check**: Both solutions include a check to see if the adjusted temperature range overlaps with the customer's preferred range. If not, it's impossible to satisfy that customer, and the solution outputs "NO".

4. **Iterative Update**: After checking each customer, the solutions update the current time and the feasible temperature range for the next iteration. This ensures that the solution is ready to handle the next customer's requirements.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of managing state (in this case, temperature) over time and ensuring that constraints are met at each step. The official solution was concise and efficient, and my approach mirrored this effectively.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the core concept was to manage a dynamic temperature range to satisfy customer preferences at specific times. The challenge was to ensure that the temperature could be adjusted within the constraints of time and customer preferences.

[Problem]
    Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

    Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

    The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

    Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

    A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

    Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


    -----Input-----

    Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

    Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

    The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

    You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


    -----Example-----
    Input
    4
    3 0
    5 1 2
    7 3 5
    10 -1 0

    1 100
    99 -100 0

    Output
    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO



    -----Note-----

    In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

    In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

    In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.
