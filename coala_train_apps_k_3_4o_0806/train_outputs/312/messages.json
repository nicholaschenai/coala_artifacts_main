If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of potential starting points of subarrays. The idea is to maintain a prefix sum array and use it to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray. The deque will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the array from the start up to index `i-1`.\n2. **Deque for Indices**: Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sum array. This will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray.\n3. **Iterate Over Prefix Sum**: For each element in the prefix sum array:\n   - Check if the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the index stored at the front of the deque is at least `K`. If it is, update the minimum length and remove the index from the deque.\n   - Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums by removing indices from the back if the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at those indices.\n   - Add the current index to the deque.\n4. **Return Result**: If a valid subarray is found, return its length; otherwise, return `-1`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction shortestSubarray(A, K):\n    n = length of A\n    prefix_sum = array of size n+1 initialized to 0\n    for i from 0 to n:\n        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n    \n    deque = empty deque\n    min_length = infinity\n    \n    for i from 0 to n:\n        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= K:\n            min_length = min(min_length, i - deque[0])\n            remove front element from deque\n        \n        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]]:\n            remove back element from deque\n        \n        add i to deque\n    \n    if min_length is infinity:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return min_length\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:\n        n = len(A)\n        # Step 1: Compute the prefix sum array\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n        \n        # Step 2: Initialize a deque to store indices and a variable for the minimum length\n        dq = deque()\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        \n        # Step 3: Iterate over the prefix sum array\n        for i in range(n + 1):\n            # Check if we can form a valid subarray with sum at least K\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:\n                min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())\n            \n            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:\n                dq.pop()\n            \n            # Add the current index to the deque\n            dq.append(i)\n        \n        # Step 4: Return the result\n        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K` using a combination of prefix sums and a deque to maintain potential starting indices.

The subsequence does not need to be contiguous, and we are only interested in the length of this subsequence.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We'll maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We initialize each `d[i]` to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element, we check all previous elements to see if they can be part of an increasing subsequence ending at the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element.

The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element.\n\n    This approach efficiently computes the LIS length in O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable given the problem constraints. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            n = len(nums)\n            d = [1] * n\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence problems and provided a clear example of how to implement it effectively.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Given an array of integers nums and an integer k.

Pseudocode Solution\n        1. Initialize a hash map `count` to store the frequency of prefix sums, starting with `count[0] = 1` to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning.\n        2. Initialize `odd_count` to 0 to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.\n        3. Initialize `result` to 0 to store the number of nice subarrays.\n        4. Iterate over each number in `nums`:\n           - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.\n           - If `odd_count - k` exists in `count`, it means there are subarrays ending at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers. Add the frequency of `odd_count - k` to `result`.\n           - Update the frequency of `odd_count` in `count`.\n        5. Return `result`.\n\n        ### 4.

This approach ensures that we can find the shortest subarray in linear time, O(n).\n\nKey strategies included:\n- Calculating prefix sums to simplify subarray sum calculations.\n- Using a deque to maintain indices of prefix sums in increasing order, which helps in efficiently finding the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.\n- Ensuring the deque only contains indices that could potentially lead to a valid subarray by removing indices that are no longer useful.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of using data structures like deques to maintain order and efficiently manage potential solutions in problems involving subarrays and prefix sums. The solution was successful and passed all test cases, confirming the effectiveness of the approach."

        "content": "Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:\n\n1. **Prefix Sum and Deque**: Both my solution and the official solution utilize the concept of prefix sums and a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`. This approach is crucial for maintaining a time complexity of O(n), which is necessary given the constraints.\n\n2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: The official solution explicitly handles negative numbers by removing any greater cumulative sums from the end of the deque. This ensures that the deque only contains potential starting points for subarrays that could lead to a valid solution. This is a subtle but important optimization that ensures the deque remains efficient.\n\n3. **Initialization and Edge Cases**: The official solution initializes the deque with a tuple `(-1, 0)`, which represents a starting point before the array begins. This is a clever way to handle edge cases where the subarray starts from the beginning of the array.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: The official solution uses a variable `result` initialized to `len(A) + 1` to track the minimum subarray length. If no valid subarray is found, it returns `-1`. This is a straightforward way to handle the case where no subarray meets the criteria.\n\nOverall, the official solution is insightful in its handling of edge cases and optimizations for negative numbers. It reinforces the importance of maintaining an efficient data structure (deque) and carefully managing prefix sums to solve the problem within the given constraints."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThe function finds the length of the shortest contiguous subarray whose sum is at least a given integer \\( K \\). It first computes the prefix sums of the input list \\( A \\) to facilitate quick subarray sum calculations. Using a deque, it efficiently maintains potential starting indices of subarrays while iterating through the prefix sums. The function updates the minimum subarray length whenever a valid subarray (with a sum of at least \\( K \\)) is found. It ensures the deque maintains indices in increasing order of their corresponding prefix sums to optimize the search for the shortest subarray. If no such subarray exists, the function returns \\(-1\\).\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to find the shortest subarray with a sum constraint, which is a common problem in competitive programming and algorithm design. The solution involves using prefix sums and a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least K. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with large arrays where a brute force approach would be too slow. Understanding this approach can help in solving similar problems where you need to find subarrays with specific properties, such as maximum sum, minimum sum, or sum within a certain range. It is also applicable in financial data analysis, signal processing, and any domain where contiguous data segments need to be analyzed for specific criteria."
