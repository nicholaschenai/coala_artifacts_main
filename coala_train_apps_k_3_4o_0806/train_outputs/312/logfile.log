INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given array `A` such that the sum of the subarray is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of potential starting points of subarrays. The idea is to maintain a prefix sum array and use it to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray. The deque will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.

### Steps:
1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the array from the start up to index `i-1`.
2. **Deque for Indices**: Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sum array. This will help us efficiently find the shortest subarray.
3. **Iterate Over Prefix Sum**: For each element in the prefix sum array:
   - Check if the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the index stored at the front of the deque is at least `K`. If it is, update the minimum length and remove the index from the deque.
   - Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums by removing indices from the back if the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at those indices.
   - Add the current index to the deque.
4. **Return Result**: If a valid subarray is found, return its length; otherwise, return `-1`.

## Pseudocode

```
function shortestSubarray(A, K):
    n = length of A
    prefix_sum = array of size n+1 initialized to 0
    for i from 0 to n:
        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]
    
    deque = empty deque
    min_length = infinity
    
    for i from 0 to n:
        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= K:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - deque[0])
            remove front element from deque
        
        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]]:
            remove back element from deque
        
        add i to deque
    
    if min_length is infinity:
        return -1
    else:
        return min_length
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def shortestSubarray(self, A: List[int], K: int) -> int:
        n = len(A)
        # Step 1: Compute the prefix sum array
        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]
        
        # Step 2: Initialize a deque to store indices and a variable for the minimum length
        dq = deque()
        min_length = float('inf')
        
        # Step 3: Iterate over the prefix sum array
        for i in range(n + 1):
            # Check if we can form a valid subarray with sum at least K
            while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:
                min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())
            
            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums
            while dq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:
                dq.pop()
            
            # Add the current index to the deque
            dq.append(i)
        
        # Step 4: Return the result
        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
```

This solution efficiently finds the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K` using a combination of prefix sums and a deque to maintain potential starting indices. The time complexity is O(n) due to the linear traversal and deque operations.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest subsequence where each number is greater than the previous one. The subsequence does not need to be contiguous, and we are only interested in the length of this subsequence.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We'll maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We initialize each `d[i]` to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element, we check all previous elements to see if they can be part of an increasing subsequence ending at the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the `d` array.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function lengthOfLIS(nums):
               if nums is empty:
                   return 0
       
               n = length of nums
               d = array of size n, initialized to 1
       
               for i from 1 to n-1:
                   for j from 0 to i-1:
                       if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                           d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
       
               return max value in d
           ```

                # If the input list is empty, the longest increasing subsequence is 0
                if not nums:
                    return 0
        
                # Initialize the dynamic programming array with 1s
                # Each element is at least an increasing subsequence of length 1 (itself)
                n = len(nums)
                d = [1] * n
        
                # Iterate over each element in the list
                for i in range(1, n):
                    # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence
                    for j in range(i):
                        # If the current element is greater than a previous element
                        if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                            # Update the dp array to reflect the longest subsequence ending at i
                            d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
                # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the dp array
                return max(d)
        ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to achieve an O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable for the problem constraints.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element.

    This approach efficiently computes the LIS length in O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable given the problem constraints. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence problems and provided a clear example of how to implement it effectively.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        To solve the problem of finding the number of "nice" subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers, we can use a sliding window approach with a hash map to efficiently count the subarrays. Here's how we can break down the problem and solution:

        ### 1. Restate the Problem
        We need to find the number of contiguous subarrays within a given array `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

        ### 2. Conceptualize a Solution
        - **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify which numbers in the array are odd.
        - **Use a Prefix Sum Approach**: We can use a prefix sum approach to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far as we iterate through the array.
        - **Count Subarrays with Exactly `k` Odd Numbers**: For each position in the array, we can determine how many subarrays end at that position and contain exactly `k` odd numbers by using a hash map to store the count of prefix sums.

        ### 3. Pseudocode Solution
        1. Initialize a hash map `count` to store the frequency of prefix sums, starting with `count[0] = 1` to handle the case where a subarray starts from the beginning.
        2. Initialize `odd_count` to 0 to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.
        3. Initialize `result` to 0 to store the number of nice subarrays.
        4. Iterate over each number in `nums`:
           - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.
           - If `odd_count - k` exists in `count`, it means there are subarrays ending at the current position with exactly `k` odd numbers. Add the frequency of `odd_count - k` to `result`.
           - Update the frequency of `odd_count` in `count`.
        5. Return `result`.

        ### 4. Final Python Solution
        ```python
        from typing import List
        from collections import defaultdict

        class Solution:
            def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:

                        odd_count += 1
            
                    # If there exists a prefix with odd_count - k, it means there are subarrays
                    # ending at the current position with exactly k odd numbers
                    if odd_count - k in count:
                        result += count[odd_count - k]
            
                    # Update the frequency of the current odd_count
                    count[odd_count] += 1
        
                return result
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code
        - We use a hash map `count` to store the frequency of each prefix sum of odd numbers.
        - `odd_count` keeps track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far.
        - For each number in `nums`, we update `odd_count` and check if there is a prefix sum that would result in exactly `k` odd numbers in the current subarray.
        - The solution efficiently counts the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers using a single pass through the array, resulting in an O(n) time complexity.

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] ### 1. Restate the Problem in Plain English

We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given array `A` such that the sum of its elements is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.

### 2. Conceptualize a Solution in Plain English

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to maintain potential starting indices of subarrays. The idea is to keep track of prefix sums and use the deque to find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.

- **Prefix Sum**: Calculate the prefix sum for each element in the array. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
- **Deque for Indices**: Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order. This helps in efficiently finding the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.
- **Sliding Window**: As we iterate through the array, we maintain a window of indices in the deque. For each new prefix sum, we check if the difference between the current prefix sum and the prefix sum at the front of the deque is at least `K`. If it is, we update the minimum length of the subarray and remove the front index from the deque.
- **Maintain Order**: Ensure that the prefix sums in the deque are in increasing order by removing indices from the back of the deque if the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at those indices.

### 3. Pseudocode Solution

```
function shortestSubarray(A, K):
    n = length of A
    prefix_sum = array of size n+1, initialized to 0
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]

    min_length = infinity

    for i from 0 to n:
        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[deque[0]] >= K:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - deque[0])
            remove front element from deque
        
        while deque is not empty and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[deque[-1]]:
            remove back element from deque

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum at least `K`. The challenge was to do this efficiently given the constraints, where the array length could be up to 50,000. 

The core concept used was the sliding window technique combined with prefix sums and a deque. The prefix sum helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray, while the deque is used to maintain potential starting indices of subarrays in an efficient manner. This approach ensures that we can find the shortest subarray in linear time, O(n).

Key strategies included:
- Calculating prefix sums to simplify subarray sum calculations.
- Using a deque to maintain indices of prefix sums in increasing order, which helps in efficiently finding the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.
- Ensuring the deque only contains indices that could potentially lead to a valid subarray by removing indices that are no longer useful.

This problem reinforced the importance of using data structures like deques to maintain order and efficiently manage potential solutions in problems involving subarrays and prefix sums. The solution was successful and passed all test cases, confirming the effectiveness of the approach.

INFO - [Task id] 312 [prompt] ### 1. Restate the Problem in Plain English

We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given array `A` such that the sum of its elements is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, we should return `-1`.

### 2. Conceptualize a Solution in Plain English

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach with a deque to maintain potential starting indices of subarrays. The idea is to keep track of prefix sums and use the deque to find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.

- **Prefix Sum**: Calculate the prefix sum for each element in the array. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
- **Deque for Indices**: Use a deque to store indices of the prefix sums in increasing order. This helps in efficiently finding the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`.
- **Sliding Window**: As we iterate through the array, we maintain a window of indices in the deque. For each new prefix sum, we check if the difference between the current prefix sum and the prefix sum at the front of the deque is at least `K`. If it is, we update the minimum length of the subarray and remove the front index from the deque.
- **Maintain Order**: Ensure that the prefix sums in the deque are in increasing order by removing indices from the back of the deque if the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at those indices.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

1. **Prefix Sum and Deque**: Both my solution and the official solution utilize the concept of prefix sums and a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray with a sum at least `K`. This approach is crucial for maintaining a time complexity of O(n), which is necessary given the constraints.

2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: The official solution explicitly handles negative numbers by removing any greater cumulative sums from the end of the deque. This ensures that the deque only contains potential starting points for subarrays that could lead to a valid solution. This is a subtle but important optimization that ensures the deque remains efficient.

3. **Initialization and Edge Cases**: The official solution initializes the deque with a tuple `(-1, 0)`, which represents a starting point before the array begins. This is a clever way to handle edge cases where the subarray starts from the beginning of the array.

4. **Result Calculation**: The official solution uses a variable `result` initialized to `len(A) + 1` to track the minimum subarray length. If no valid subarray is found, it returns `-1`. This is a straightforward way to handle the case where no subarray meets the criteria.

Overall, the official solution is insightful in its handling of edge cases and optimizations for negative numbers. It reinforces the importance of maintaining an efficient data structure (deque) and carefully managing prefix sums to solve the problem within the given constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] The function finds the length of the shortest contiguous subarray whose sum is at least a given integer \( K \). It first computes the prefix sums of the input list \( A \) to facilitate quick subarray sum calculations. Using a deque, it efficiently maintains potential starting indices of subarrays while iterating through the prefix sums. The function updates the minimum subarray length whenever a valid subarray (with a sum of at least \( K \)) is found. It ensures the deque maintains indices in increasing order of their corresponding prefix sums to optimize the search for the shortest subarray. If no such subarray exists, the function returns \(-1\).
