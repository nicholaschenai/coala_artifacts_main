## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a number of test cases. For each test case, we have two integers, N and K. We need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair in the permutation equals K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):** 
   - For a permutation P of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], the function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximums of each consecutive pair in the permutation.
   - For example, if P = [p1, p2, ..., pN], then f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

2. **Constraints and Observations:**
   - The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of [1, 2, ..., N] is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, i.e., N + (N-1) + ... + 2.
   - The minimum possible value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.

3. **Approach:**
   - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - Start with the permutation [N, N-1, ..., 1].
   - Calculate the current sum of maximums.
   - If the current sum is greater than K, swap elements to reduce the sum until it equals K.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_permutation(N, K):
    max_sum = N + (N-1) + ... + 2
    min_sum = N - 1
    
    if K < min_sum or K > max_sum:
        return -1
    
    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
    current_sum = max_sum
    
    for i from 0 to N-2:
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        # Try to reduce the sum by swapping
        for j from N-1 down to i+1:
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                swap(permutation[i], permutation[j])
                break
    
    return permutation

read T
for each test case:
    read N, K
    result = find_permutation(N, K)
    print result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_permutation(N, K):
    # Calculate the maximum and minimum possible sums
    max_sum = sum(range(2, N + 1))
    min_sum = N - 1
    
    # If K is out of the possible range, return -1
    if K < min_sum or K > max_sum:
        return -1
    
    # Start with the permutation in decreasing order
    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
    current_sum = max_sum
    
    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
    for i in range(N - 1):
        if current_sum == K:
            break
        # Try to reduce the sum by swapping
        for j in range(N - 1, i, -1):
            if current_sum - (permutation[i] - permutation[j]) >= K:
                current_sum -= (permutation[i] - permutation[j])
                permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]
                break
    
    return permutation

import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

T = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(T):
    N = int(data[index])
    K = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    result = find_permutation(N, K)
    if result == -1:
        results.append("-1")
    else:
        results.append(" ".join(map(str, result)))

sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the required permutation or -1 if no valid permutation exists. The function `find_permutation` constructs the permutation by starting with the maximum possible sum and adjusting it to match K.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.

    #### Strategies and Mistakes
    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.

    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.

    ### Code Snippet

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            n, strengths = test_case
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
            alternating_sum = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                else:
                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
            results.append(alternating_sum)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
            test_cases.append((n, strengths))
    
        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

        This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

        Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

        But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

        First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

        As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

        The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

        Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

        Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

        Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

        Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!

        Each test contains multiple test cases.

        The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

        The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

        The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

        $i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

        It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


        -----Output-----

        For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


        -----Example-----
        Input
        3
        3 0
        1 3 2
        2 0
        1 2
        7 0
        1 2 5 4 3 6 7

        Output
        3
        2
        9



        -----Note-----

        In third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be $5‚àí3+7=9$.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake might be.

        ### Problem Analysis

        The task is to find the maximum alternating sum of a subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The goal is to maximize this sum.

        ### Solution Analysis

        1. **Sorting**: The solution sorts the strengths in descending order. This is correct because we want to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.

        2. **Alternating Sum Calculation**: The solution iterates through the sorted list and adds elements at even indices and subtracts elements at odd indices. This is where the mistake lies.

        ### Mistake Identification

        The mistake in the solution is in the assumption that the alternating sum should be calculated by strictly alternating between addition and subtraction based on the index in the sorted list. However, the problem allows us to choose any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.

        ### Correct Approach

        - We should iterate through the sorted list and decide whether to include each element in the sum based on whether it increases the sum.
        - Specifically, we should add an element if it increases the sum (i.e., if the current sum is non-negative, add the next element; if the current sum is negative, skip the next element).

        ### Revised Pseudocode

        ```
        function max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
            results = []
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                n, strengths = test_case
                sort strengths in descending order
                alternating_sum = 0
                for i from 0 to n-1:
                    if i is even:
                        alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                    else:
                        if alternating_sum - strengths[i] > alternating_sum:
                            alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
                append alternating_sum to results
            return results
        ```

        ### Revised Python Code

        ```python
        def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                n, strengths = test_case
                # Sort the strengths in descending order
                strengths.sort(reverse=True)
                # Calculate the alternating sum
                alternating_sum = 0
                for i in range(n):
                    if i % 2 == 0:
                        alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                    else:
                        if alternating_sum - strengths[i] > alternating_sum:
                            alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
                # Store the result for this test case
                results.append(alternating_sum)
            return results

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            t = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            test_cases = []
    
            for _ in range(t):
                n = int(data[index])
                q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0 in this version
                index += 2
                strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
                index += n
                test_cases.append((n, strengths))
    
            results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Decision Making**: The revised solution checks whether subtracting the next element would actually increase the alternating sum. If it doesn't, the element is skipped.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution remains efficient, as it only involves sorting and a single pass through the list.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Let's address the issue with the previous solution. The problem is to find the maximum alternating sum of a subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The goal is to maximize this sum.

        The mistake in the previous solution was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. We need to ensure that we are maximizing the sum by choosing the right elements to add or subtract.

        Here's the corrected solution:

        ```python
        def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
            results = []
            for test_case in test_cases:
                n, strengths = test_case
                # Sort the strengths in descending order
                strengths.sort(reverse=True)
                # Calculate the alternating sum
                alternating_sum = 0
                for i in range(n):
                    if i % 2 == 0:
                        alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                    else:
                        alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
                # Store the result for this test case
                results.append(alternating_sum)
            return results

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            t = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            test_cases = []
    
            for _ in range(t):
                n = int(data[index])
                q = int(data[index + 1])  # q is always 0 in this version
                index += 2
                strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
                index += n
                test_cases.append((n, strengths))
    
            results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Sorting**: The strengths are sorted in descending order to ensure that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.
        - **Alternating Sum Calculation**: We iterate through the sorted list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that we are maximizing the alternating sum by leveraging the largest available values.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 300,000 Pok√©mon across all test cases due to the sorting step, which is the most computationally expensive operation.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Problem Restatement
We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find a permutation such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

### Conceptual Solution
1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:
   \[
   f(P) = \max(p_1, p_2) + \max(p_2, p_3) + \ldots + \max(p_{N-1}, p_N)
   \]

2. **Constraints and Observations**:
   - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
   - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \(\frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\).

3. **Approach**:
   - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

### Pseudocode
```
function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    for each (N, K) in test_cases:
        if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:
            output -1
        else:
            permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
            current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
            i = 0
            while current_sum > K:
                if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:
                    swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
                    current_sum -= 1
                i += 1
            output permutation
```

### Final Python Code
```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
            i = 0
            while current_sum > K:
                if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_sum -= 1
                i += 1
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

```

### Explanation
- We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
- We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.
- This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Problem Restatement
We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find a permutation such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

### Conceptual Solution
1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:
   \[
   f(P) = \max(p_1, p_2) + \max(p_2, p_3) + \ldots + \max(p_{N-1}, p_N)
   \]

2. **Constraints and Observations**:
   - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
   - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \(\frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\).

3. **Approach**:
   - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

### Pseudocode
```
function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    for each (N, K) in test_cases:
        if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:
            output -1
        else:
            permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
            current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
            i = 0
            while current_sum > K:
                if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:
                    swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
                    current_sum -= 1
                i += 1
            output permutation
```

### Final Python Code
```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
            i = 0
            while current_sum > K:
                if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_sum -= 1
                i += 1
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

```

### Explanation
- We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
- We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.
- This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

### Analysis of the Current Solution
1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input and `sys.stdout.write` to output results. This is appropriate for competitive programming but can be tricky if not handled correctly. The function `find_permutation` is defined but not called, which means the code doesn't execute.

2. **Logic for Permutation Construction**:
   - The logic attempts to start with the maximum possible sum by using a descending order permutation.
   - It then tries to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K by swapping adjacent elements.

3. **Mistakes and Misunderstandings**:
   - The function `find_permutation` is defined but never called, so no logic is executed.
   - The permutation adjustment logic might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the sum needs to be reduced by more than one at a time.
   - The permutation construction logic might not correctly handle cases where the desired sum K is exactly the maximum possible sum.

### Steps to Correct the Solution
1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: Make sure the function is executed by calling it after its definition.
2. **Refine the Permutation Adjustment Logic**:
   - Ensure that the logic correctly reduces the sum to K by considering larger swaps or more efficient adjustments.
   - Handle edge cases where the desired sum is exactly the maximum possible sum.

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure correctness.

### Revised Solution
Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def find_permutation():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)
        min_possible = N - 1
        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        
        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            # Start with the permutation in descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_possible
            
            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the current max of the pair
                current_max = max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1])
                # Calculate the new max if we swap
                new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)
                # Calculate the difference
                diff = current_max - new_max
                # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap
                if current_sum - diff >= K:
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_sum -= diff
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the function to execute
find_permutation()
```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.
- **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Problem Restatement
We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find a permutation such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

### Conceptual Solution
1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:
   \[
   f(P) = \max(p_1, p_2) + \max(p_2, p_3) + \ldots + \max(p_{N-1}, p_N)
   \]

2. **Constraints and Observations**:
   - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
   - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \(\frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\).

3. **Approach**:
   - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

### Pseudocode
```
function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    for each (N, K) in test_cases:
        if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:
            output -1

            output permutation
```

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.

    #### Strategies and Mistakes
    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.

    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.

    ### Code Snippet

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            n, strengths = test_case
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
            alternating_sum = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                else:
                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
            results.append(alternating_sum)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
            test_cases.append((n, strengths))
    
        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

    [Task]:
        You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

        Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

        -----Input-----
        The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
        The second line contains the string S.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 50
        - 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 50
        - S will consist of uppercase English letters.

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        2
        4
        DCBA
        7
        XYZZYZZ

        Output:
        ADCB
        XYYZZZZ

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
        Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

        1. **Reading Input:**
           - The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is not called, the input won't be processed.

        2. **Function Call:**
           - The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is defined but never called. This is why no output is produced.

        3. **Logic for Finding the Smallest String:**
           - The logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character is correct. It iterates over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` and checks if moving `S[j]` to position `i` results in a smaller string.

        4. **Output:**
           - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which is correct.

        **Steps to Fix:**

        - Ensure the function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string()` is called so that the input is processed and output is generated.

        Here's the corrected code with the function call added:

        ```python
        def find_lexicographically_smallest_string():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            index = 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                S = data[index + 1]
                index += 2
        
                # Initialize the minimum string as the original string
                min_string = S
        
                # Try to find a better string by moving one character
                for i in range(N):
                    for j in range(i + 1, N):
                        if S[j] < S[i]:
                            # Create a new string by moving S[j] to position i
                            new_string = S[:i] + S[j] + S[i:j] + S[j+1:]
                            # Update min_string if the new string is smaller
                            if new_string < min_string:
                                min_string = new_string
        
                # Store the result for this test case
                results.append(min_string)
    
            # Print all results
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the function to execute the solution
        find_lexicographically_smallest_string()
        ```

        This code should now correctly read from standard input, process each test case, and print the expected output.

- **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.

This code should now correctly read from standard input, process each test case, and print the expected output.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

Reason through the problem and:

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

### Problem Restatement
We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find a permutation such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

### Conceptual Solution
1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:
   \[
   f(P) = \max(p_1, p_2) + \max(p_2, p_3) + \ldots + \max(p_{N-1}, p_N)
   \]

2. **Constraints and Observations**:
   - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
   - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \(\frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\).

3. **Approach**:
   - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

### Pseudocode
```
function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    for each (N, K) in test_cases:
        if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:
            output -1
        else:
            permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
            current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
            i = 0
            while current_sum > K:
                if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:
                    swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
                    current_sum -= 1
                i += 1
            output permutation
```

### Final Python Code
```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
            i = 0
            while current_sum > K:
                if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_sum -= 1
                i += 1
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

```

### Explanation
- We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
- We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.
- This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

### Analysis of the Current Solution
1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input and `sys.stdout.write` to output results. This is appropriate for competitive programming but can be tricky if not handled correctly. The function `find_permutation` is defined but not called, which means the code doesn't execute.

2. **Logic for Permutation Construction**:
   - The logic attempts to start with the maximum possible sum by using a descending order permutation.
   - It then tries to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K by swapping adjacent elements.

3. **Mistakes and Misunderstandings**:
   - The function `find_permutation` is defined but never called, so no logic is executed.
   - The permutation adjustment logic might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the sum needs to be reduced by more than one at a time.
   - The permutation construction logic might not correctly handle cases where the desired sum K is exactly the maximum possible sum.

### Steps to Correct the Solution
1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: Make sure the function is executed by calling it after its definition.
2. **Refine the Permutation Adjustment Logic**:
   - Ensure that the logic correctly reduces the sum to K by considering larger swaps or more efficient adjustments.
   - Handle edge cases where the desired sum is exactly the maximum possible sum.

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure correctness.

### Revised Solution
Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

def find_permutation():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)
        min_possible = N - 1
        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        
        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            # Start with the permutation in descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_possible
            
            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the current max of the pair
                current_max = max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1])
                # Calculate the new max if we swap
                new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)
                # Calculate the difference
                diff = current_max - new_max
                # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap
                if current_sum - diff >= K:
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]

- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] In tackling the problem of finding a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K, I learned several key concepts and strategies:

### Core Concepts
- **Permutation and Sum Calculation**: Understanding how to calculate the sum of maximums of consecutive pairs in a permutation and how to manipulate the permutation to achieve a desired sum.
- **Constraints Handling**: Recognizing the minimum and maximum possible values of the function f(P) and using these to quickly determine if a solution is possible.

### Strategies and Fixes
- **Initial Approach**: Starting with a descending order permutation to achieve the maximum possible sum and then adjusting it to reach the desired sum K by swapping elements.
- **Function Execution**: Ensuring the function is called correctly to execute the logic, which was initially missed.
- **Efficient Adjustment**: Implementing a loop to adjust the permutation by swapping adjacent elements, ensuring the sum is reduced correctly without overshooting the target K.

### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
- **Function Not Called**: The initial solution defined the function but did not call it, leading to no execution. This was fixed by explicitly calling the function.
- **Permutation Adjustment Logic**: The logic needed refinement to handle cases where the sum needed to be reduced by more than one at a time, which was addressed by checking the difference in sums before and after potential swaps.

This problem reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling in competitive programming and the need for efficient algorithms to handle large constraints.

1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:
   \[
   f(P) = \max(p_1, p_2) + \max(p_2, p_3) + \ldots + \max(p_{N-1}, p_N)
   \]

2. **Constraints and Observations**:
   - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
   - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \(\frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\).

3. **Approach**:
   - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
   - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
   - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

### Pseudocode
```
function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    for each (N, K) in test_cases:
        if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:
            output -1
        else:
            permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
            current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
            i = 0
            while current_sum > K:
                if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:
                    swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
                    current_sum -= 1
                i += 1
            output permutation
```

### Final Python Code
```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
            i = 0
            while current_sum > K:
                if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_sum -= 1
                i += 1
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

```

### Explanation
- We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
- We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.
- This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

### Analysis of the Current Solution
1. **Input/Output Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read` to read input and `sys.stdout.write` to output results. This is appropriate for competitive programming but can be tricky if not handled correctly. The function `find_permutation` is defined but not called, which means the code doesn't execute.

2. **Logic for Permutation Construction**:
   - The logic attempts to start with the maximum possible sum by using a descending order permutation.
   - It then tries to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K by swapping adjacent elements.

3. **Mistakes and Misunderstandings**:
   - The function `find_permutation` is defined but never called, so no logic is executed.
   - The permutation adjustment logic might not correctly handle all cases, especially when the sum needs to be reduced by more than one at a time.
   - The permutation construction logic might not correctly handle cases where the desired sum K is exactly the maximum possible sum.

### Steps to Correct the Solution
1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: Make sure the function is executed by calling it after its definition.
2. **Refine the Permutation Adjustment Logic**:
   - Ensure that the logic correctly reduces the sum to K by considering larger swaps or more efficient adjustments.
   - Handle edge cases where the desired sum is exactly the maximum possible sum.

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test the solution with various edge cases to ensure correctness.

### Revised Solution
Let's revise the solution to address these issues:

```python
def find_permutation():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        K = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        # Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values of f(P)
        min_possible = N - 1
        max_possible = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
        
        if K < min_possible or K > max_possible:
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            # Start with the permutation in descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_possible
            
            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the desired sum K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the current max of the pair
                current_max = max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1])
                # Calculate the new max if we swap
                new_max = max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i + 2] if i + 2 < N else 0)
                # Calculate the difference
                diff = current_max - new_max
                # If swapping reduces the sum enough, perform the swap
                if current_sum - diff >= K:
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_sum -= diff
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the function to execute
find_permutation()
```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Function Call**: The function `find_permutation` is now called at the end of the script to ensure execution.
- **Permutation Adjustment**: The logic now checks if swapping adjacent elements can reduce the sum to K and performs the swap if it does.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The logic ensures that the sum is adjusted correctly without overshooting the desired value K.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this permutation problem, there are several key insights and lessons learned:

1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem required constructing a permutation such that the sum of the maximums of consecutive pairs equals a given integer K. The constraints on the minimum and maximum possible values of this sum were crucial in determining if a solution was possible.

2. **Initial Approach and Mistakes**: My initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation to achieve the maximum possible sum and then adjusting it to reach K. However, the logic for adjusting the permutation was not robust enough to handle all cases, particularly when the sum needed to be reduced by more than one at a time.

3. **Importance of Function Execution**: A critical oversight was not calling the function that contained the main logic, which resulted in no output. This highlights the importance of ensuring that all parts of the code are executed as intended.

4. **Official Solution Insights**: The official solution provided a more structured approach to handling even and odd values of N separately. It efficiently calculates the possible range for K and constructs the permutation by strategically placing elements to achieve the desired sum. This approach is more systematic and handles edge cases more effectively.

5. **Key Takeaways**:
   - Always verify that the function containing the main logic is called.
   - Consider edge cases and ensure the logic can handle adjustments to the permutation sum efficiently.
   - Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (like handling even and odd N separately) can simplify the solution.

These insights will be valuable for tackling similar permutation and combinatorial problems in the future.

[Problem]
    For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
    You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
    Note f([1]) = 0.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
    Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

    - 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
    - Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106

    2 2
    5 14

    Output:
    -1
    1 2
    5 4 3 2 1

    -----Explanation-----
    Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
    Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
    Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.
