    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\nAlice has a set of cards represented by an array of integers. She wants to rearrange these cards into groups where each group has exactly `W` cards, and the cards in each group are consecutive numbers. We need to determine if it's possible to rearrange the cards in such a way.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the following approach:\n- First, check if the total number of cards is divisible by `W`. If not, it's impossible to form groups of size `W`.\n- Sort the cards to easily find consecutive sequences.\n- Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each card.\n- Iterate through the sorted cards, and for each card, try to form a group of `W` consecutive cards. Decrease the count of each card used in forming a group.\n- If at any point, a card needed to form a group is not available, return `False`.\n- If all cards can be grouped successfully, return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n```\nfunction isNStraightHand(hand, W):\n    if length of hand is not divisible by W:\n        return False\n    \n    sort the hand\n    create a dictionary to count occurrences of each card\n    \n    for each card in sorted hand:\n        if count of card is greater than 0:\n            for i from 0 to W-1:\n                if count of card + i is 0:\n                    return False\n                decrease count of card + i by 1\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], W: int) -> bool:\n        # Check if the total number of cards is divisible by W\n        if len(hand) % W != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # Sort the hand to easily find consecutive sequences\n        hand.sort()\n        \n        # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each card\n        card_count = {}\n        for card in hand:\n            if card in card_count:\n                card_count[card] += 1\n            else:\n                card_count[card] = 1\n        \n        # Try to form groups of W consecutive cards\n        for card in hand:\n            if card_count[card] > 0:\n                # Attempt to form a group starting with this card\n                for i in range(W):\n                    if card_count.get(card + i, 0) == 0:\n                        return False\n                    card_count[card + i] -= 1\n        \n        # If all cards can be grouped successfully, return True\n        return True\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently checks if the cards can be grouped into consecutive sequences of size `W` by leveraging sorting and a dictionary to track card counts.",
