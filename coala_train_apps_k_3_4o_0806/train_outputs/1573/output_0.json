    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we should provide a valid match result matrix where each player wins the same number of matches. If not, we should return \"NO\".\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Match Matrix**: \n   - For `N` players, each player plays `N-1` matches (one against each other player).\n   - The match results can be represented as an `N x N` matrix where the element at row `i` and column `j` is `1` if player `i` beats player `j`, and `0` otherwise.\n   - The diagonal of this matrix should be all zeros because a player cannot play against themselves.\n\n2. **Equal Wins Condition**:\n   - Each player should win exactly the same number of matches.\n   - This is only possible if `N` is odd. If `N` is even, it's impossible because the total number of matches is `N * (N-1) / 2`, which is not divisible evenly among `N` players.\n\n3. **Constructing the Matrix**:\n   - If `N` is odd, we can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly `(N-1)/2` matches.\n   - For each player `i`, they can win against the next `(N-1)/2` players in a cyclic manner.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of test cases `T`.\n2. For each test case:\n   - Read the number of players `N`.\n   - If `N` is even, print \"NO\".\n   - If `N` is odd:\n     - Print \"YES\".\n     - Initialize an `N x N` matrix with all zeros.\n     - For each player `i` from `0` to `N-1`:\n       - For the next `(N-1)/2` players, set the matrix entry to `1` indicating player `i` wins.\n     - Print the matrix.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef solve_tournament():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        \n        if N % 2 == 0:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]\n            \n            for i in range(N):\n                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):\n                    winner = (i + j) % N\n                    matrix[i][winner] = '1'\n            \n            for row in matrix:\n                results.append(''.join(row))\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, checks if the number of players `N` is odd. If `N` is odd, it constructs a valid match result matrix where each player wins exactly `(N-1)/2` matches. If `N` is even, it outputs \"NO\" since it's impossible to distribute wins equally.",
