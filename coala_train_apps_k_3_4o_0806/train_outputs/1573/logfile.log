## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we need to provide a specific arrangement of match outcomes. If not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Each player plays against every other player exactly once.
   - There are no ties, so each match has a winner and a loser.
   - We need to ensure that each player wins the same number of matches.

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - For each player to win the same number of matches, the total number of matches (which is `N * (N - 1) / 2`) must be divisible by `N`. This is only possible if `N` is odd. If `N` is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches.

3. **Constructing the Match Outcomes**:
   - If `N` is odd, we can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly `(N - 1) / 2` matches.
   - For each player `i`, they can win against the next `(N - 1) / 2` players in a cyclic manner.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of players `N`.
   - If `N` is even, print "NO".
   - If `N` is odd:
     - Print "YES".
     - Initialize an `N x N` matrix with all zeros.
     - For each player `i` from 0 to `N-1`:
       - For the next `(N - 1) / 2` players, set the matrix entry to 1 indicating player `i` wins.
     - Print the matrix.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        if N % 2 == 0:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            # Create an N x N matrix initialized with '0'
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            
            # Each player i wins against the next (N-1)/2 players
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):
                    winner = i
                    loser = (i + j) % N
                    matrix[winner][loser] = '1'
            
            for row in matrix:
                results.append(''.join(row))
    
    # Print all results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the results according to the problem's requirements. It constructs a valid tournament scenario when possible and indicates when it's not possible.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    **Core Concepts and Patterns:**
    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days using a set of four dishes, ensuring that no two consecutive days have the same dish and that the first and last days are different. The key challenge is to derive a formula that accounts for these constraints efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    **Initial Strategy:**
    The initial approach was to use a formula that calculated the total number of ways to arrange the dishes and then subtract the invalid cases where the first and last days are the same. This approach was incorrect because it did not accurately account for the constraints, particularly for larger values of \( N \).

    **Correct Strategy:**
    The correct formula is:
    \[ \text{Schedules}(N) = 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \]
    This formula:
    - Starts with 4 choices for the first day.
    - Uses \( 3^{(N-2)} \) for the middle days, ensuring no two consecutive days are the same.
    - Ends with 2 choices for the last day to ensure it is different from the first day.

    **Unexpected Errors and Fixes:**
    The main error was in the miscalculation of the invalid schedules. The realization that the formula should directly account for the constraints without needing to subtract invalid cases was crucial. The use of Python's `pow` function with a modulus was essential to handle large numbers efficiently.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * pow(3, N-2, MOD) * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and ensuring that the formula used directly reflects those constraints.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we should provide a valid match result matrix where each player wins the same number of matches. If not, we should return "NO".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Match Matrix**: 
   - For `N` players, each player plays `N-1` matches (one against each other player).
   - The match results can be represented as an `N x N` matrix where the element at row `i` and column `j` is `1` if player `i` beats player `j`, and `0` otherwise.
   - The diagonal of this matrix should be all zeros because a player cannot play against themselves.

2. **Equal Wins Condition**:
   - Each player should win exactly the same number of matches.
   - This is only possible if `N` is odd. If `N` is even, it's impossible because the total number of matches is `N * (N-1) / 2`, which is not divisible evenly among `N` players.

3. **Constructing the Matrix**:
   - If `N` is odd, we can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly `(N-1)/2` matches.
   - For each player `i`, they can win against the next `(N-1)/2` players in a cyclic manner.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of players `N`.
   - If `N` is even, print "NO".
   - If `N` is odd:
     - Print "YES".
     - Initialize an `N x N` matrix with all zeros.
     - For each player `i` from `0` to `N-1`:
       - For the next `(N-1)/2` players, set the matrix entry to `1` indicating player `i` wins.
     - Print the matrix.

### Python Code

```python
def solve_tournament():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        if N % 2 == 0:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            
            for i in range(N):

 ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we should provide a valid match result matrix where each player wins the same number of matches. If not, we should return "NO".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Match Matrix**: 
   - For `N` players, each player plays `N-1` matches (one against each other player).
   - The match results can be represented as an `N x N` matrix where the element at row `i` and column `j` is `1` if player `i` beats player `j`, and `0` otherwise.
   - The diagonal of this matrix should be all zeros because a player cannot play against themselves.

2. **Equal Wins Condition**:
   - Each player should win exactly the same number of matches.
   - This is only possible if `N` is odd. If `N` is even, it's impossible because the total number of matches is `N * (N-1) / 2`, which is not divisible evenly among `N` players.

3. **Constructing the Matrix**:
   - If `N` is odd, we can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly `(N-1)/2` matches.
   - For each player `i`, they can win against the next `(N-1)/2` players in a cyclic manner.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of players `N`.
   - If `N` is even, print "NO".
   - If `N` is odd:
     - Print "YES".
     - Initialize an `N x N` matrix with all zeros.
     - For each player `i` from `0` to `N-1`:
       - For the next `(N-1)/2` players, set the matrix entry to `1` indicating player `i` wins.
     - Print the matrix.

### Python Code

```python
def solve_tournament():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        if N % 2 == 0:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):
                    winner = (i + j) % N
                    matrix[i][winner] = '1'
            
            for row in matrix:
                results.append(''.join(row))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve_tournament()` was defined but not called. In a competitive programming environment, the function needs to be executed to produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the function `solve_tournament()` is called after its definition so that it executes and produces the required output.

2. **Standard Input/Output**: The code should correctly read from standard input and write to standard output. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once, but we need to ensure the function is called to process this input.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the output format matches the expected format, especially the separation of test cases and the correct order of results.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def solve_tournament():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        if N % 2 == 0:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):
                    winner = (i + j) % N
                    matrix[i][winner] = '1'
            
            for row in matrix:
                results.append(''.join(row))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution
solve_tournament()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve_tournament()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Output Handling**: The function now correctly processes input and outputs the results for each test case in the required format.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected and ensure the solution is executed correctly.

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we should provide a valid match result matrix where each player wins the same number of matches. If not, we should return "NO".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Match Matrix**: 
   - For `N` players, each player plays `N-1` matches (one against each other player).
   - The match results can be represented as an `N x N` matrix where the element at row `i` and column `j` is `1` if player `i` beats player `j`, and `0` otherwise.
   - The diagonal of this matrix should be all zeros because a player cannot play against themselves.

2. **Equal Wins Condition**:
   - Each player should win exactly the same number of matches.
   - This is only possible if `N` is odd. If `N` is even, it's impossible because the total number of matches is `N * (N-1) / 2`, which is not divisible evenly among `N` players.

3. **Constructing the Matrix**:
   - If `N` is odd, we can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly `(N-1)/2` matches.
   - For each player `i`, they can win against the next `(N-1)/2` players in a cyclic manner.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of players `N`.
   - If `N` is even, print "NO".
   - If `N` is odd:
     - Print "YES".
     - Initialize an `N x N` matrix with all zeros.
     - For each player `i` from `0` to `N-1`:
       - For the next `(N-1)/2` players, set the matrix entry to `1` indicating player `i` wins.
     - Print the matrix.

### Python Code

```python
def solve_tournament():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        if N % 2 == 0:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):
                    winner = (i + j) % N
                    matrix[i][winner] = '1'
            
            for row in matrix:
                results.append(''.join(row))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, checks if the number of players `N` is odd. If `N` is odd, it constructs a valid match result matrix where each player wins exactly `(N-1)/2` matches. If `N` is even, it outputs "NO" since it's impossible to distribute wins equally.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve_tournament()` was defined but not called. In a competitive programming environment, the function needs to be executed to produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the function `solve_tournament()` is called after its definition so that it executes and produces the required output.

2. **Standard Input/Output**: The code should correctly read from standard input and write to standard output. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once, but we need to ensure the function is called to process this input.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the output format matches the expected format, especially the separation of test cases and the correct order of results.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def solve_tournament():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        if N % 2 == 0:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):
                    winner = (i + j) % N
                    matrix[i][winner] = '1'
            
            for row in matrix:

    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to execute the solution

```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve_tournament()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Output Handling**: The function now correctly processes input and outputs the results for each test case in the required format.

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected and ensure the solution is executed correctly.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to generate a specific pattern based on an integer \( K \) for multiple test cases. The pattern required was a sequence of lines where each line \( i \) (0-indexed) contains the string "10" repeated \( i+1 \) times. The challenge was to correctly interpret the pattern and implement it efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Pattern Recognition**: Understanding that the pattern alternates between "1" and "0" starting with "1" for each line.
    - **Iterative Construction**: Using loops to construct each line of the pattern based on the current index.

    ### Strategies:
    - Initially, I misunderstood the pattern as a numeric sequence, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct approach was to focus on alternating characters.
    - The solution involved iterating over each test case and constructing each line by alternating "1" and "0" for the required number of times.

    ### Lessons Learned:
    - **Pattern Construction**: When dealing with pattern problems, it's crucial to carefully analyze the example outputs to understand the underlying logic.
    - **Iterative Logic**: Using loops effectively to build strings based on index values can simplify the problem-solving process.
    - **Debugging**: When the output doesn't match expectations, revisiting the problem statement and examples can help realign the solution approach.

    ### Final Solution:
    The final solution involved reading input values, iterating over each test case, and generating the required pattern by alternating "1" and "0" for each line. This approach successfully passed all test cases.

    ```python
    def generate_pattern():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        # Read each test case value
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        # For each test case
        for K in test_cases:
            # Generate K lines
            for i in range(K):
                # Start with "1" and alternate between "0" and "1"
                line = ''.join('1' if j % 2 == 0 else '0' for j in range(i + 1))
                # Print the line
                print(line)

    # Call the function to execute the pattern generation
    generate_pattern()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding problem requirements and iteratively refining the solution to meet those requirements.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The function `solve_tournament()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure it executes and processes the input.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings for processing.
- **Logic**: For each test case, the number of players `N` is checked. If `N` is even, it's impossible to have each player win the same number of matches, so "NO" is appended to the results. If `N` is odd, a valid match result matrix is constructed where each player wins `(N-1)/2` matches.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each test case's output is separated correctly.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2

2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we should provide a valid match result matrix where each player wins the same number of matches. If not, we should return "NO".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Match Matrix**: 
   - For `N` players, each player plays `N-1` matches (one against each other player).
   - The match results can be represented as an `N x N` matrix where the element at row `i` and column `j` is `1` if player `i` beats player `j`, and `0` otherwise.
   - The diagonal of this matrix should be all zeros because a player cannot play against themselves.

2. **Equal Wins Condition**:
   - Each player should win exactly the same number of matches.
   - This is only possible if `N` is odd. If `N` is even, it's impossible because the total number of matches is `N * (N-1) / 2`, which is not divisible evenly among `N` players.

3. **Constructing the Matrix**:
   - If `N` is odd, we can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly `(N-1)/2` matches.
   - For each player `i`, they can win against the next `(N-1)/2` players in a cyclic manner.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of players `N`.
   - If `N` is even, print "NO".
   - If `N` is odd:
     - Print "YES".
     - Initialize an `N x N` matrix with all zeros.
     - For each player `i` from `0` to `N-1`:
       - For the next `(N-1)/2` players, set the matrix entry to `1` indicating player `i` wins.
     - Print the matrix.

### Python Code

```python
def solve_tournament():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        if N % 2 == 0:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):
                    winner = (i + j) % N
                    matrix[i][winner] = '1'
            
            for row in matrix:
                results.append(''.join(row))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, checks if the number of players `N` is odd. If `N` is odd, it constructs a valid match result matrix where each player wins exactly `(N-1)/2` matches. If `N` is even, it outputs "NO" since it's impossible to distribute wins equally.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve_tournament()` was defined but not called. In a competitive programming environment, the function needs to be executed to produce the output.

### Steps to Correct the Code

1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the function `solve_tournament()` is called after its definition so that it executes and produces the required output.

2. **Standard Input/Output**: The code should correctly read from standard input and write to standard output. The current implementation uses `sys.stdin.read()` which is appropriate for reading all input at once, but we need to ensure the function is called to process this input.

3. **Output Verification**: Ensure that the output format matches the expected format, especially the separation of test cases and the correct order of results.

### Corrected Python Code

```python
def solve_tournament():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1

### Explanation

- **Function Call**: The function `solve_tournament()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure it executes and processes the input.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings for processing.
- **Logic**: For each test case, the number of players `N` is checked. If `N` is even, it's impossible to have each player win the same number of matches, so "NO" is appended to the results. If `N` is odd, a valid match result matrix is constructed where each player wins `(N-1)/2` matches.
- **Output**: The results are printed in the required format, ensuring each test case's output is separated correctly.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches, and if so, to construct a valid match result matrix. The key insight was recognizing that this is only possible when the number of players, `N`, is odd. This is because each player needs to win `(N-1)/2` matches, which is only feasible when `N` is odd.

The solution involved constructing an `N x N` matrix where each player `i` wins against the next `(N-1)/2` players in a cyclic manner. This ensures that each player wins the same number of matches. The matrix is filled with '1's and '0's, where a '1' at position `(i, j)` indicates that player `i` beats player `j`.

A common pitfall was ensuring the function was called to execute the solution, which was initially missed. This was corrected by explicitly calling the function at the end of the script. Additionally, handling input and output correctly using `sys.stdin.read()` and ensuring the results were printed in the correct format were crucial for passing all test cases.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding the constraints and properties of the problem (odd vs. even `N`) and ensuring that the solution is executed properly in a competitive programming environment.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if it's possible for each player in a tennis tournament to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we should provide a valid match result matrix where each player wins the same number of matches. If not, we should return "NO".

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Match Matrix**: 
   - For `N` players, each player plays `N-1` matches (one against each other player).
   - The match results can be represented as an `N x N` matrix where the element at row `i` and column `j` is `1` if player `i` beats player `j`, and `0` otherwise.
   - The diagonal of this matrix should be all zeros because a player cannot play against themselves.

2. **Equal Wins Condition**:
   - Each player should win exactly the same number of matches.
   - This is only possible if `N` is odd. If `N` is even, it's impossible because the total number of matches is `N * (N-1) / 2`, which is not divisible evenly among `N` players.

3. **Constructing the Matrix**:
   - If `N` is odd, we can construct a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly `(N-1)/2` matches.
   - For each player `i`, they can win against the next `(N-1)/2` players in a cyclic manner.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the number of players `N`.
   - If `N` is even, print "NO".
   - If `N` is odd:
     - Print "YES".
     - Initialize an `N x N` matrix with all zeros.
     - For each player `i` from `0` to `N-1`:
       - For the next `(N-1)/2` players, set the matrix entry to `1` indicating player `i` wins.
     - Print the matrix.

### Python Code

```python
def solve_tournament():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        if N % 2 == 0:
            results.append("NO")
        else:
            results.append("YES")
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, (N // 2) + 1):
                    winner = (i + j) % N
                    matrix[i][winner] = '1'
            
            for row in matrix:
                results.append(''.join(row))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, checks if the number of players `N` is odd. If `N` is odd, it constructs a valid match result matrix where each player wins exactly `(N-1)/2` matches. If `N` is even, it outputs "NO" since it's impossible to distribute wins equally.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this task, there are a few key insights and takeaways:

1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem required determining if each player in a tournament could win the same number of matches. The critical insight was recognizing that this is only possible when the number of players, `N`, is odd. This is because an odd number allows for a cyclic pattern where each player can win against exactly half of the other players.

2. **Matrix Construction**: Both my solution and the official solution used a similar approach to construct the match result matrix. The idea is to use a cyclic pattern to ensure each player wins `(N-1)/2` matches. This involves iterating over each player and marking wins against the next `(N-1)/2` players in a cyclic manner.

3. **Handling Input and Output**: The official solution uses a straightforward approach to handle input and output, which is crucial in competitive programming. It reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually, printing results immediately. This is a good practice to ensure clarity and correctness in output.

4. **Efficiency and Simplicity**: The official solution is efficient and simple, focusing on the core logic without unnecessary complexity. It directly constructs the result matrix using list operations and string concatenation, which is both time-efficient and easy to understand.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in constraints (like the odd/even distinction) and using simple, direct methods to construct solutions. The official solution aligns closely with my approach, confirming the correctness of the logic used.

The main function is `solve_tournament`.
INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] The function reads input data to determine the number of test cases and processes each test case to decide if a tournament with a given number of players can be organized such that each player plays every other player exactly once. For each test case, if the number of players is even, it appends "NO" to the results list, indicating that such a tournament is not possible. If the number of players is odd, it appends "YES" and constructs a matrix representing the tournament schedule, where '1' indicates a win for the row player against the column player, ensuring each player plays every other player exactly once. The function then prints the results for each test case, including the tournament matrix for cases where a valid schedule is possible.

[Problem]
    A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
    Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
    With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
    Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

    -----Output:-----
    - If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
    - Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
    - If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
    - You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
    - You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $2 \leq N \leq 100$

    -----Subtasks-----
    - 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
    - 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    3
    2

    -----Sample Output:-----
    YES
    010
    001
    100
    NO

    -----Explanation:-----
    One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.
