## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If no such triangle can exist, we should output \(-1\).

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides \( a \), \( b \), and hypotenuse \( c \), the Pythagorean theorem states: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).
   - The area \( A \) of the triangle is given by: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).

2. **Given Conditions**:
   - We are given \( c = H \) and \( A = S \).

3. **Formulate the Problem**:
   - From the area formula: \( a \times b = 2S \).
   - From the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).

4. **Solve for \( a \) and \( b \)**:
   - Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area equation: \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Substitute \( b \) in the Pythagorean equation: \( a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 = H^2 \).
   - Simplify and solve the resulting quadratic equation in terms of \( a^2 \).

5. **Check for Validity**:
   - Ensure that the discriminant of the quadratic equation is non-negative for real solutions.
   - Calculate \( a \) and \( b \) and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality and area conditions.

6. **Output**:
   - If valid \( a \) and \( b \) are found, output them along with \( H \) in sorted order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output \(-1\).

## Pseudocode

```
function find_triangle_sides(H, S):
    if 4 * S > H^2:
        return -1
    discriminant = H^4 - 16 * S^2
    if discriminant < 0:
        return -1
    a_squared = (H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    b_squared = (H^2 - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    if a_squared < 0 or b_squared < 0:
        return -1
    a = sqrt(a_squared)
    b = sqrt(b_squared)
    return sorted([a, b, H])

read T
for each test case:
    read H, S
    result = find_triangle_sides(H, S)
    print result
```

## Python Code

```python
import sys
import math

def find_triangle_sides(H, S):
    # Check if the area is too large for the given hypotenuse
    if 4 * S > H * H:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation
    discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
    
    # If the discriminant is negative, no real solutions exist
    if discriminant < 0:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate a^2 and b^2 using the quadratic formula
    a_squared = (H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    b_squared = (H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
    
    # If either a^2 or b^2 is negative, no valid triangle sides exist
    if a_squared < 0 or b_squared < 0:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the actual side lengths
    a = math.sqrt(a_squared)
    b = math.sqrt(b_squared)
    
    # Return the sides sorted in non-decreasing order
    return f"{min(a, b):.5f} {max(a, b):.5f} {H:.5f}"

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):

        - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
        - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
        - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
        He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
        You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid.

        ### Problem Restatement

        We have a string `S` and we form a pyramid where each row `N` contains `N` characters. The characters in each row are formed by repeating the string `S` in a cyclic manner. We are given another string `T` and need to answer `Q` queries. Each query provides a row number `N`, and we need to determine how many times the string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Pyramid**: 
           - The `N`-th row of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string `S` until it reaches a length of `N`.
           - This means the `N`-th row is `S` repeated `N // len(S)` times plus the first `N % len(S)` characters of `S`.

        2. **Finding Substring Occurrences**:
           - For each query, construct the `N`-th row as described.
           - Count the number of times `T` appears as a substring in this row.

        3. **Efficiency Considerations**:
           - Directly constructing the `N`-th row for very large `N` is inefficient.
           - Instead, use the properties of cyclic repetition to determine the row content without explicitly constructing it.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
            results = []
            len_s = length of S
            len_t = length of T

            for each query N in queries:
                # Calculate the effective row
                full_repeats = N // len_s
                remainder = N % len_s

                # Construct the row
                row = S * full_repeats + S[:remainder]

                # Count occurrences of T in the row
                count = 0
                for i from 0 to length of row - len_t:
                    if row[i:i+len_t] == T:
                        count += 1

                results.append(count)

            return results
        ```

        ### Final Python Code

        ```python
        def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
            results = []
            len_s = len(S)
            len_t = len(T)

            for N in queries:
                # Calculate the effective row
                full_repeats = N // len_s
                remainder = N % len_s

                # Construct the row
                row = S * full_repeats + S[:remainder]

                # Count occurrences of T in the row
                count = 0
                for i in range(len(row) - len_t + 1):
                    if row[i:i+len_t] == T:
                        count += 1

                results.append(count)

            return results

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            S = data[0]
            T = data[1]
            Q = int(data[2])
            queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]
    
            results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **Row Construction**: For each query, we determine how many full repetitions of `S` fit into the row and how many additional characters are needed.
        - **Substring Search**: We then search for `T` in this constructed row.
        - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles the construction of the row and the search for `T` by leveraging Python's string slicing and comparison operations.

The solution involved calculating the x-coordinate using the formula derived from the line equation that passes through both points and reflects off the x-axis. The key formula used was:

    \[ x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x1 \times y2 + x2 \times y1}{y1 + y2} \]

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Geometry and Reflection**: The problem required understanding the concept of reflection and how to calculate the midpoint of a line segment projected onto an axis.
    - **Precision Handling**: The output needed to be formatted to two decimal places, which was achieved using Python's string formatting.

    ### Strategies and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function was called fixed this issue.
    - **Output Formatting**: Using formatted strings to ensure the output met the precision requirements was crucial.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_mirror_position():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            x1 = int(data[index])
            y1 = int(data[index + 1])
            x2 = int(data[index + 2])
            y2 = int(data[index + 3])
        
            index += 4
        
            x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
        
            results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    calculate_mirror_position()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and the utility of precise string formatting for output requirements.

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for counting triangles with vertices of the same color, I learned several key insights:

    1. **Grouping by Color**: Both my solution and the official solution effectively grouped points by color, which is crucial for calculating triangles within each color group. This step simplifies the problem by reducing it to smaller subproblems.

    2. **Triangle Validation**: The official solution uses a different method to check if three points form a triangle. It calculates the side lengths and uses Heron's formula to compute the area, ensuring it's greater than zero. This approach is robust and avoids potential pitfalls with floating-point arithmetic when checking collinearity using determinants.

    3. **Handling Zero Triangles**: The official solution elegantly handles the case where no triangles are formed by checking if the maximum number of triangles (`mx`) is zero and adjusting the output accordingly. This was a point of failure in my initial attempts, where I struggled with the correct output format for zero triangles.

    4. **Output Construction**: The official solution constructs the output in a concise manner, using list comprehensions and conditional expressions to handle different cases. This approach is both efficient and readable.

    Overall, the official solution provided a more robust method for triangle validation and a cleaner approach to constructing the output. These insights can be applied to similar problems involving geometric computations and combinatorial counting.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length `H` and area `S`. If possible, we should output the lengths of the sides of the triangle in non-decreasing order. If not, we should output `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and hypotenuse `c`, the Pythagorean theorem states: `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
   - The area `S` of the triangle is given by: `S = (1/2) * a * b`.

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given `H` (hypotenuse) and `S` (area).
   - We need to find `a` and `b` such that:
     - `a^2 + b^2 = H^2`
     - `a * b = 2 * S`

3. **Solving the Equations**:
   - From `a * b = 2 * S`, express `b` in terms of `a`: `b = (2 * S) / a`.
   - Substitute `b` in the Pythagorean theorem: `a^2 + ((2 * S) / a)^2 = H^2`.
   - This simplifies to a quadratic equation in terms of `a^2`.

4. **Quadratic Equation**:
   - Let `x = a^2`. The equation becomes: `x^2 - H^2 * x + (2 * S)^2 = 0`.
   - Solve this quadratic equation for `x` using the quadratic formula: `x = (H^2 Â± sqrt(H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2)) / 2`.

5. **Checking Validity**:
   - Ensure the discriminant `H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2` is non-negative for real solutions.
   - Calculate `a` and `b` from the valid `x` and check if they satisfy the original conditions.

6. **Output**:
   - If valid `a` and `b` are found, output them along with `H` in non-decreasing order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output `-1`.

        else:
            x1 = (H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
            x2 = (H^2 - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
            if x1 >= 0:
                a = sqrt(x1)
                b = (2 * S) / a
                if a^2 + b^2 == H^2:
                    output sorted(a, b, H)

                a = sqrt(x2)

We need to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length `H` and area `S`. If possible, we should output the lengths of the sides of the triangle in non-decreasing order. If not, we should output `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and hypotenuse `c`, the Pythagorean theorem states: `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
   - The area `S` of the triangle is given by: `S = (1/2) * a * b`.

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given `H` (hypotenuse) and `S` (area).
   - We need to find `a` and `b` such that:
     - `a^2 + b^2 = H^2`
     - `a * b = 2 * S`

3. **Solving the Equations**:
   - From `a * b = 2 * S`, express `b` in terms of `a`: `b = (2 * S) / a`.
   - Substitute `b` in the Pythagorean theorem: `a^2 + ((2 * S) / a)^2 = H^2`.
   - This simplifies to a quadratic equation in terms of `a^2`.

4. **Quadratic Equation**:
   - Let `x = a^2`. The equation becomes: `x^2 - H^2 * x + (2 * S)^2 = 0`.
   - Solve this quadratic equation for `x` using the quadratic formula: `x = (H^2 Â± sqrt(H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2)) / 2`.

5. **Checking Validity**:
   - Ensure the discriminant `H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2` is non-negative for real solutions.
   - Calculate `a` and `b` from the valid `x` and check if they satisfy the original conditions.

6. **Output**:
   - If valid `a` and `b` are found, output them along with `H` in non-decreasing order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output `-1`.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being read or how the output is being written. Let's go through the code step-by-step to identify potential issues:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then splits it into a list of strings. This is generally correct for competitive programming, but we need to ensure that the input is being processed correctly.

2. **Output Handling**:
   - The results are collected in a list and then written to standard output using `sys.stdout.write()`. This should work, but we need to ensure that the function `find_triangle_sides()` is actually being called.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The function `find_triangle_sides()` is defined but not called anywhere in the script. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced.

### Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Ensure the Function is Called**:
   - We need to call the `find_triangle_sides()` function to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input and Output**:
   - Double-check that the input is being read correctly and that the output is formatted as expected.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**:
   - Ensure that the logic for solving the quadratic equation and checking the conditions for a valid triangle is correct.

### Revised Code

Let's fix the code by ensuring the function is called and verify the input/output handling:

```python
import sys
import math

def find_triangle_sides():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        H = int(data[index])
        S = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        H2 = H * H
        S2 = 2 * S
        discriminant = H2 * H2 - 4 * S2 * S2
        
        if discriminant < 0:
            results.append("-1")
            continue
        
        sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)
        
        x1 = (H2 + sqrt_discriminant) / 2
        x2 = (H2 - sqrt_discriminant) / 2
        
        found = False
        
        for x in [x1, x2]:
            if x >= 0:
                a = math.sqrt(x)
                if a != 0:
                    b = S2 / a
                    if abs(a * a + b * b - H2) < 0.01:
                        sides = sorted([a, b, H])
                        results.append(f"{sides[0]:.5f} {sides[1]:.5f} {sides[2]:.5f}")
                        found = True
                        break
        
        if not found:
            results.append("-1")
    
    sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

# Call the function to execute the solution
find_triangle_sides()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: Added a call to `find_triangle_sides()` at the end of the script to ensure the function is executed.
- **Input/Output**: Verified that the input is read correctly and the output is formatted as expected. The logic for solving the quadratic equation and checking the triangle conditions remains unchanged.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length `H` and area `S`. If possible, we should output the lengths of the sides of the triangle in non-decreasing order. If not, we should output `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and hypotenuse `c`, the Pythagorean theorem states: `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
   - The area `S` of the triangle is given by: `S = (1/2) * a * b`.

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given `H` (hypotenuse) and `S` (area).
   - We need to find `a` and `b` such that:
     - `a^2 + b^2 = H^2`
     - `a * b = 2 * S`

3. **Solving the Equations**:
   - From `a * b = 2 * S`, express `b` in terms of `a`: `b = (2 * S) / a`.
   - Substitute `b` in the Pythagorean theorem: `a^2 + ((2 * S) / a)^2 = H^2`.
   - This simplifies to a quadratic equation in terms of `a^2`.

4. **Quadratic Equation**:
   - Let `x = a^2`. The equation becomes: `x^2 - H^2 * x + (2 * S)^2 = 0`.
   - Solve this quadratic equation for `x` using the quadratic formula: `x = (H^2 Â± sqrt(H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2)) / 2`.

5. **Checking Validity**:
   - Ensure the discriminant `H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2` is non-negative for real solutions.
   - Calculate `a` and `b` from the valid `x` and check if they satisfy the original conditions.

6. **Output**:
   - If valid `a` and `b` are found, output them along with `H` in non-decreasing order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output `-1`.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_triangle_sides(T, test_cases):
    for each (H, S) in test_cases:
        calculate discriminant = H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2
        if discriminant < 0:
            output -1
        else:
            x1 = (H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
            x2 = (H^2 - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
            if x1 >= 0:
                a = sqrt(x1)
                b = (2 * S) / a
                if a^2 + b^2 == H^2:
                    output sorted(a, b, H)
            if x2 >= 0:
                a = sqrt(x2)
                b = (2 * S) / a
                if a^2 + b^2 == H^2:
                    output sorted(a, b, H)
            if no valid (a, b) found:
                output -1

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine the x-coordinate on the x-axis where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile. The solution involved calculating the x-coordinate using the formula derived from the line equation that passes through both points and reflects off the x-axis. The key formula used was:

    \[ x_{\text{mirror}} = \frac{x1 \times y2 + x2 \times y1}{y1 + y2} \]

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Geometry and Reflection**: The problem required understanding the concept of reflection and how to calculate the midpoint of a line segment projected onto an axis.
    - **Precision Handling**: The output needed to be formatted to two decimal places, which was achieved using Python's string formatting.

    ### Strategies and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the function was called fixed this issue.
    - **Output Formatting**: Using formatted strings to ensure the output met the precision requirements was crucial.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_mirror_position():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            x1 = int(data[index])
            y1 = int(data[index + 1])
            x2 = int(data[index + 2])
            y2 = int(data[index + 3])
        
            index += 4
        
            x_mirror = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
        
            results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    calculate_mirror_position()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and the utility of precise string formatting for output requirements.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for counting triangles with vertices of the same color, I learned several key insights:

    1. **Grouping by Color**: Both my solution and the official solution effectively grouped points by color, which is crucial for calculating triangles within each color group. This step simplifies the problem by reducing it to smaller subproblems.

    2. **Triangle Validation**: The official solution uses a different method to check if three points form a triangle. It calculates the side lengths and uses Heron's formula to compute the area, ensuring it's greater than zero. This approach is robust and avoids potential pitfalls with floating-point arithmetic when checking collinearity using determinants.

    3. **Handling Zero Triangles**: The official solution elegantly handles the case where no triangles are formed by checking if the maximum number of triangles (`mx`) is zero and adjusting the output accordingly. This was a point of failure in my initial attempts, where I struggled with the correct output format for zero triangles.

    4. **Output Construction**: The official solution constructs the output in a concise manner, using list comprehensions and conditional expressions to handle different cases. This approach is both efficient and readable.

    Overall, the official solution provided a more robust method for triangle validation and a cleaner approach to constructing the output. These insights can be applied to similar problems involving geometric computations and combinatorial counting.

Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length `H` and area `S`. If possible, we should output the lengths of the sides of the triangle in non-decreasing order. If not, we should output `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and hypotenuse `c`, the Pythagorean theorem states: `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
   - The area `S` of the triangle is given by: `S = (1/2) * a * b`.

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given `H` (hypotenuse) and `S` (area).
   - We need to find `a` and `b` such that:
     - `a^2 + b^2 = H^2`
     - `a * b = 2 * S`

3. **Solving the Equations**:
   - From `a * b = 2 * S`, express `b` in terms of `a`: `b = (2 * S) / a`.
   - Substitute `b` in the Pythagorean theorem: `a^2 + ((2 * S) / a)^2 = H^2`.
   - This simplifies to a quadratic equation in terms of `a^2`.

4. **Quadratic Equation**:
   - Let `x = a^2`. The equation becomes: `x^2 - H^2 * x + (2 * S)^2 = 0`.
   - Solve this quadratic equation for `x` using the quadratic formula: `x = (H^2 Â± sqrt(H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2)) / 2`.

5. **Checking Validity**:
   - Ensure the discriminant `H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2` is non-negative for real solutions.
   - Calculate `a` and `b` from the valid `x` and check if they satisfy the original conditions.

6. **Output**:
   - If valid `a` and `b` are found, output them along with `H` in non-decreasing order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output `-1`.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_triangle_sides(T, test_cases):
    for each (H, S) in test_cases:
        calculate discriminant = H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2
        if discriminant < 0:
            output -1
        else:
            x1 = (H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
            x2 = (H^2 - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
            if x1 >= 0:
                a = sqrt(x1)
                b = (2 * S) / a
                if a^2 + b^2 == H^2:
                    output sorted(a, b, H)

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

The feedback indicates that the code is not producing any output. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the input is being read or how the output is being written. Let's go through the code step-by-step to identify potential issues:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read all input at once and then splits it into a list of strings. This is generally correct for competitive programming, but we need to ensure that the input is being processed correctly.

2. **Output Handling**:
   - The results are collected in a list and then written to standard output using `sys.stdout.write()`. This should work, but we need to ensure that the function `find_triangle_sides()` is actually being called.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The function `find_triangle_sides()` is defined but not called anywhere in the script. This is likely the reason why no output is being produced.

### Steps to Fix the Code

1. **Ensure the Function is Called**:
   - We need to call the `find_triangle_sides()` function to execute the logic.

2. **Verify Input and Output**:
   - Double-check that the input is being read correctly and that the output is formatted as expected.

3. **Re-evaluate the Logic**:
   - Ensure that the logic for solving the quadratic equation and checking the conditions for a valid triangle is correct.

### Revised Code

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] ### Summary of Problem-Solving Process

In this problem, we needed to determine if a right-angled triangle could be formed with a given hypotenuse `H` and area `S`. The core concepts involved were the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge was to solve these equations simultaneously to find the triangle's side lengths.

#### Key Concepts and Patterns

1. **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and hypotenuse `c`, the relationship is `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
2. **Area of Triangle**: The area `S` is given by `S = (1/2) * a * b`.
3. **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting `b = (2 * S) / a` into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation in terms of `a^2`.

#### Strategies and Fixes

- **Initial Approach**: The initial solution correctly derived the quadratic equation and attempted to solve it using the quadratic formula. However, the function was not called, leading to no output.
- **Fixing the Function Call**: The main issue was the absence of a function call, which was resolved by adding `find_triangle_sides()` at the end of the script.
- **Input/Output Handling**: Ensured that input was read using `sys.stdin.read()` and output was written using `sys.stdout.write()`, which is standard for competitive programming.

#### Lessons Learned

- Always ensure that the main function is called in scripts, especially when using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` for input/output.
- Verify the discriminant of a quadratic equation to ensure real solutions exist.
- Carefully handle floating-point arithmetic to maintain precision, especially when checking conditions like `a^2 + b^2 = H^2`.

This problem reinforced the importance of correctly setting up and solving equations derived from geometric properties and ensuring that the program's execution flow is complete.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length `H` and area `S`. If possible, we should output the lengths of the sides of the triangle in non-decreasing order. If not, we should output `-1`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right-angled triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and hypotenuse `c`, the Pythagorean theorem states: `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.
   - The area `S` of the triangle is given by: `S = (1/2) * a * b`.

2. **Formulating the Problem**:
   - We are given `H` (hypotenuse) and `S` (area).
   - We need to find `a` and `b` such that:
     - `a^2 + b^2 = H^2`
     - `a * b = 2 * S`

3. **Solving the Equations**:
   - From `a * b = 2 * S`, express `b` in terms of `a`: `b = (2 * S) / a`.
   - Substitute `b` in the Pythagorean theorem: `a^2 + ((2 * S) / a)^2 = H^2`.
   - This simplifies to a quadratic equation in terms of `a^2`.

4. **Quadratic Equation**:
   - Let `x = a^2`. The equation becomes: `x^2 - H^2 * x + (2 * S)^2 = 0`.
   - Solve this quadratic equation for `x` using the quadratic formula: `x = (H^2 Â± sqrt(H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2)) / 2`.

5. **Checking Validity**:
   - Ensure the discriminant `H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2` is non-negative for real solutions.
   - Calculate `a` and `b` from the valid `x` and check if they satisfy the original conditions.

6. **Output**:
   - If valid `a` and `b` are found, output them along with `H` in non-decreasing order.
   - If no valid solution exists, output `-1`.

### Pseudocode

function find_triangle_sides(T, test_cases):
    for each (H, S) in test_cases:
        calculate discriminant = H^4 - 4 * (2 * S)^2
        if discriminant < 0:
            output -1
        else:
            x1 = (H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
            x2 = (H^2 - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2
            if x1 >= 0:
                a = sqrt(x1)
                b = (2 * S) / a
                if a^2 + b^2 == H^2:
                    output sorted(a, b, H)
            if x2 >= 0:
                a = sqrt(x2)
                b = (2 * S) / a

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

The problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse and area was an interesting exercise in applying mathematical concepts to programming. Here are some key insights and reflections from the experience:

1. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The problem required translating geometric properties into algebraic equations. The key was to use the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle to derive a quadratic equation. This was a crucial step in both my solution and the official one.

2. **Quadratic Equation**:
   - Both solutions involved solving a quadratic equation derived from the conditions given (hypotenuse and area). The discriminant check was essential to ensure real solutions exist, which was correctly implemented in both solutions.

3. **Precision and Output**:
   - Handling floating-point precision was important, especially when comparing calculated values to expected ones. The official solution used formatted output to ensure the precision requirement was met, which is a good practice in competitive programming.

4. **Function Execution**:
   - A key oversight in my initial solution was not calling the function that contained the main logic. This was a simple yet critical mistake that led to no output being produced. Ensuring that the main logic is executed is fundamental.

5. **Comparison with Official Solution**:
   - The official solution was more concise and directly computed the potential side lengths using a straightforward approach. It used a different method to derive the side lengths, which was insightful and slightly more efficient in terms of computation.

Overall, this exercise reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation, attention to detail in function execution, and precision in output formatting. These are valuable lessons for tackling similar problems in the future.

The main function is `find_triangle_sides`.
INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] The function reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases, each specifying the height and area of a right-angled triangle. For each test case, it calculates the possible lengths of the two other sides of the triangle using the given height and area. It checks if the calculated sides form a valid triangle by verifying the Pythagorean theorem and the area condition. If a valid set of sides is found, it appends the sorted side lengths to the results list in a formatted string; otherwise, it appends "-1" if no valid sides exist. Finally, it writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.
