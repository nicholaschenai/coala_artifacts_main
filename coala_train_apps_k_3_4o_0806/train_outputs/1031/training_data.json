    "summary": "### Summary of Problem-Solving Process\n\nIn this problem, we needed to determine if a right-angled triangle could be formed with a given hypotenuse `H` and area `S`. The core concepts involved were the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge was to solve these equations simultaneously to find the triangle's side lengths.\n\n#### Key Concepts and Patterns\n\n1. **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle with sides `a`, `b`, and hypotenuse `c`, the relationship is `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.\n2. **Area of Triangle**: The area `S` is given by `S = (1/2) * a * b`.\n3. **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting `b = (2 * S) / a` into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation in terms of `a^2`.\n\n#### Strategies and Fixes\n\n- **Initial Approach**: The initial solution correctly derived the quadratic equation and attempted to solve it using the quadratic formula. However, the function was not called, leading to no output.\n- **Fixing the Function Call**: The main issue was the absence of a function call, which was resolved by adding `find_triangle_sides()` at the end of the script.\n- **Input/Output Handling**: Ensured that input was read using `sys.stdin.read()` and output was written using `sys.stdout.write()`, which is standard for competitive programming.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n- Always ensure that the main function is called in scripts, especially when using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` for input/output.\n- Verify the discriminant of a quadratic equation to ensure real solutions exist.\n- Carefully handle floating-point arithmetic to maintain precision, especially when checking conditions like `a^2 + b^2 = H^2`.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of correctly setting up and solving equations derived from geometric properties and ensuring that the program's execution flow is complete.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse and area was an interesting exercise in applying mathematical concepts to programming. Here are some key insights and reflections from the experience:\n\n1. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - The problem required translating geometric properties into algebraic equations. The key was to use the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle to derive a quadratic equation. This was a crucial step in both my solution and the official one.\n\n2. **Quadratic Equation**:\n   - Both solutions involved solving a quadratic equation derived from the conditions given (hypotenuse and area). The discriminant check was essential to ensure real solutions exist, which was correctly implemented in both solutions.\n\n3. **Precision and Output**:\n   - Handling floating-point precision was important, especially when comparing calculated values to expected ones. The official solution used formatted output to ensure the precision requirement was met, which is a good practice in competitive programming.\n\n4. **Function Execution**:\n   - A key oversight in my initial solution was not calling the function that contained the main logic. This was a simple yet critical mistake that led to no output being produced. Ensuring that the main logic is executed is fundamental.\n\n5. **Comparison with Official Solution**:\n   - The official solution was more concise and directly computed the potential side lengths using a straightforward approach. It used a different method to derive the side lengths, which was insightful and slightly more efficient in terms of computation.\n\nOverall, this exercise reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation, attention to detail in function execution, and precision in output formatting. These are valuable lessons for tackling similar problems in the future.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_triangle_sides]\nThe function reads input from standard input, which consists of multiple test cases, each specifying the height and area of a right-angled triangle. For each test case, it calculates the possible lengths of the two other sides of the triangle using the given height and area. It checks if the calculated sides form a valid triangle by verifying the Pythagorean theorem and the area condition. If a valid set of sides is found, it appends the sorted side lengths to the results list in a formatted string; otherwise, it appends \"-1\" if no valid sides exist. Finally, it writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the feasibility of constructing a right-angled triangle given specific constraints on its hypotenuse and area. This can be applied in geometry problems, computer graphics, and design where specific dimensions are required. It is also relevant in mathematical problem-solving and competitive programming where understanding the relationship between the sides of a triangle and its area is crucial. Additionally, this solution demonstrates how to handle multiple test cases efficiently, which is a common requirement in programming contests."
