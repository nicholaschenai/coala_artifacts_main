INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `d`. We can jump from an index `i` to another index `j` if:
- `arr[i] > arr[j]`
- All elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`
- The jump distance `|i - j|` is at most `d`

The task is to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit starting from any index in the array.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to calculate the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index and use these results to build up the solution.

2. **Recursive Function with Memoization**: Define a recursive function `max_jumps_from(i)` that returns the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. Use memoization to store results of previously computed indices to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Jumping Logic**: For each index `i`, try to jump to all possible indices `j` within the range `[i-d, i+d]` that satisfy the conditions:
   - `arr[i] > arr[j]`
   - All elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`

4. **Iterate Over All Indices**: Compute the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index and return the maximum of these values.

## Pseudocode

```
function maxJumps(arr, d):
    n = length of arr
    memo = array of size n initialized to -1

    function max_jumps_from(i):
        if memo[i] is not -1:
            return memo[i]
        
        max_jumps = 1  // At least the current index can be visited

        // Check forward jumps
        for j from i+1 to min(i+d, n-1):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))
            else:
                break  // Cannot jump further in this direction

        // Check backward jumps
        for j from i-1 to max(i-d, 0):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))
            else:
                break  // Cannot jump further in this direction

        memo[i] = max_jumps
        return max_jumps

    max_result = 0
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        max_result = max(max_result, max_jumps_from(i))

    return max_result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxJumps(self, arr: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        memo = [-1] * n

        def max_jumps_from(i: int) -> int:
            if memo[i] != -1:
                return memo[i]
            
            max_jumps = 1  # At least the current index can be visited

            # Check forward jumps
            for j in range(i + 1, min(i + d + 1, n)):
                if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                    max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))
                else:
                    break  # Cannot jump further in this direction

            # Check backward jumps
            for j in range(i - 1, max(i - d - 1, -1), -1):
                if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                    max_jumps = max(max_jumps, 1 + max_jumps_from(j))
                else:
                    break  # Cannot jump further in this direction

            memo[i] = max_jumps
            return max_jumps

        max_result = 0
        for i in range(n):
            max_result = max(max_result, max_jumps_from(i))

        return max_result
```

This solution uses a recursive function with memoization to efficiently calculate the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index, and then returns the maximum of these values.

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    It is also possible to restore the subsequence using this approach.
    This time we have to maintain two auxiliary arrays.
    One that tells us the index of the elements in $d[]$.
    And again we have to create an array of "ancestors" $p[i]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index of the previous element for the optimal subsequence ending in element $i$.

    It's easy to maintain these two arrays in the course of iteration over the array $a[]$ alongside the computations of $d[]$.
    And at the end it is not difficult to restore the desired subsequence using these arrays.

    ## Solution in $O(n \log n)$ with data structures {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n log n) with data structures"}

    Instead of the above method for computing the longest increasing subsequence in $O(n \log n)$ we can also solve the problem in a different way: using some simple data structures.

    Let's go back to the first method.
    Remember that $d[i]$ is the value $d[j] + 1$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

    Thus if we define an additional array $t[]$ such that

    $$t[a[i]] = d[i],$$

    then the problem of computing the value $d[i]$ is equivalent to finding the **maximum value in a prefix** of the array $t[]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(t[0 \dots a[i] - 1] + 1\right)$$

    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. 
    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).

    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:
    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.
    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).
    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.

    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:
    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.
    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).

    ## Related tasks

    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.

    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence

    This is in fact nearly the same problem.
    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.

    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.
    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.

    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences

    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.
    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.

    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.
    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.

    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \log n)$.

    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.

    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence

    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.

    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    **Proof**:
    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.

    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.
    We need to prove that $x = y$.

    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.
    Therefore we have $y \ge x$.

    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.
    Suppose that $y > x$.
    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.
    We transform this in set in the following way:
    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.
    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.
    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.

    Thus it follows that $y = x$.

    **Restoring the sequences**:
    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.
    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.

    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}

[Reflection]:
    The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. My initial approach used a dynamic programming array to track possible sums, which is a common technique for partition problems.

    The official solution, however, uses a set to track possible sums, which is a more elegant and concise approach. Here's a breakdown of the official solution:

    1. **Initialization**: Start with a set `dp` containing only the sum `0`. This set will be used to track all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones.

    2. **Iterate through stones**: For each stone, update the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in `dp`. This is done using set comprehension, which efficiently updates the set with new possible sums.

    3. **Calculate the result**: After processing all stones, the set `dp` contains all possible sums. The goal is to find the sum that, when doubled and subtracted from the total weight, gives the smallest possible result. This is achieved by iterating through the set and calculating the minimum of `abs(total - 2 * _sum)` for each `_sum` in `dp`.

    The official solution is insightful because it leverages Python's set operations to efficiently manage and update possible sums, resulting in a more concise and potentially faster implementation compared to the traditional dynamic programming array approach. This solution is particularly elegant in its use of set comprehension to handle the sum updates in a single line, making the code both compact and easy to understand.

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `d`. We can jump from an index `i` to another index `j` if:
- `arr[i] > arr[j]`
- All elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`
- The jump distance `|i - j|` is less than or equal to `d`

The task is to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit starting from any index in the array.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll maintain a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`.

2. **Sorting by Value**: To efficiently determine the order of processing, we can sort the indices based on the values in `arr`. This allows us to process the indices in increasing order of their values, ensuring that when we process an index, all possible jumps to lower values have already been considered.

3. **Updating the DP Array**: For each index `i`, we will:
   - Check all possible jumps to the right (i.e., `i + x` where `1 <= x <= d`).
   - Check all possible jumps to the left (i.e., `i - x` where `1 <= x <= d`).
   - Update `dp[i]` based on valid jumps to indices with smaller values.

4. **Result**: The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array, as it represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from any index.

### Pseudocode

```
function maxJumps(arr, d):
    n = length of arr
    dp = array of size n initialized to 1
    indices = array of indices from 0 to n-1
    sort indices based on values in arr

    for each index i in indices:
        for x from 1 to d:
            if i + x < n and arr[i] > arr[i + x]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i + x] + 1)
            else:
                break
        for x from 1 to d:
            if i - x >= 0 and arr[i] > arr[i - x]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - x] + 1)
            else:
                break

    return max value in dp
```

### Final Python Solution

    def maxJumps(self, arr: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        dp = [1] * n

        indices.sort(key=lambda i: arr[i])

        for i in indices:
            # Check right jumps
            for x in range(1, d + 1):
                if i + x < n and arr[i] > arr[i + x]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i + x] + 1)
                else:

        return max(dp)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize a `dp` array where each element is set to 1, indicating that each index can at least visit itself.
- We sort the indices based on the values in `arr` to ensure we process smaller values first.
- For each index, we attempt to jump both to the right and left within the allowed distance `d`, updating the `dp` array based on valid jumps.
- Finally, we return the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from any index.

We are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `d`. We can jump from an index `i` to another index `j` if:
- `arr[i] > arr[j]`
- All elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`
- The jump distance `|i - j|` is less than or equal to `d`

The task is to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit starting from any index in the array.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll maintain a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`.

2. **Sorting by Value**: To efficiently determine the order of processing, we can sort the indices based on the values in `arr`. This allows us to process the indices in increasing order of their values, ensuring that when we process an index, all possible jumps to lower values have already been considered.

3. **Updating the DP Array**: For each index `i`, we will:
   - Check all possible jumps to the right (i.e., `i + x` where `1 <= x <= d`).
   - Check all possible jumps to the left (i.e., `i - x` where `1 <= x <= d`).
   - Update `dp[i]` based on valid jumps to indices with smaller values.

4. **Result**: The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array, as it represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from any index.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] In this problem, the core concept revolves around dynamic programming and sorting to efficiently determine the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array, given specific jumping constraints. The problem tests the ability to use dynamic programming to track the maximum number of jumps possible from each index, while also leveraging sorting to ensure that jumps are considered in the correct order of values.

The successful strategy involved:
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**: Using a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. This approach allows us to build up solutions incrementally.
2. **Sorting by Value**: Sorting indices based on the values in the array ensures that when processing an index, all potential jumps to lower values have already been considered. This is crucial for correctly updating the `dp` array.
3. **Iterative Jump Checking**: For each index, checking possible jumps both to the right and left within the allowed distance `d`, and updating the `dp` array based on valid jumps.

The solution was implemented successfully without encountering significant errors, and the approach was validated by passing all test cases. This problem reinforced the importance of combining sorting with dynamic programming to solve complex jumping problems efficiently. The key takeaway is the effective use of sorting to manage dependencies in dynamic programming problems.

Input: arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.
Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.
Similarly You cannot jump from index 3 to index 2 or index 1.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,3], d = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: You can start at any index. You always cannot jump to any index.

Example 3:
Input: arr = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 1
Output: 7
Explanation: Start at index 0. You can visit all the indicies. 

Example 4:
Input: arr = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 2
Output: 2

Example 5:
Input: arr = [66], d = 1
Output: 1

INFO - [Task id] 155 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `d`. We can jump from an index `i` to another index `j` if:
- `arr[i] > arr[j]`
- All elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`
- The jump distance `|i - j|` is less than or equal to `d`

The task is to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit starting from any index in the array.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We'll maintain a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`.

2. **Sorting by Value**: To efficiently determine the order of processing, we can sort the indices based on the values in `arr`. This allows us to process the indices in increasing order of their values, ensuring that when we process an index, all possible jumps to lower values have already been considered.

3. **Updating the DP Array**: For each index `i`, we will:
   - Check all possible jumps to the right (i.e., `i + x` where `1 <= x <= d`).
   - Check all possible jumps to the left (i.e., `i - x` where `1 <= x <= d`).
   - Update `dp[i]` based on valid jumps to indices with smaller values.

4. **Result**: The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array, as it represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from any index.

### Pseudocode

```
function maxJumps(arr, d):
    n = length of arr
    dp = array of size n initialized to 1
    indices = array of indices from 0 to n-1
    sort indices based on values in arr

    for each index i in indices:
        for x from 1 to d:
            if i + x < n and arr[i] > arr[i + x]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i + x] + 1)
            else:
                break
        for x from 1 to d:
            if i - x >= 0 and arr[i] > arr[i - x]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - x] + 1)
            else:
                break

    return max value in dp
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxJumps(self, arr: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        dp = [1] * n
        indices = list(range(n))
        indices.sort(key=lambda i: arr[i])

        for i in indices:
            # Check right jumps
            for x in range(1, d + 1):
                if i + x < n and arr[i] > arr[i + x]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i + x] + 1)
                else:
                    break
            # Check left jumps
            for x in range(1, d + 1):
                if i - x >= 0 and arr[i] > arr[i - x]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - x] + 1)
                else:
                    break

        return max(dp)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize a `dp` array where each element is set to 1, indicating that each index can at least visit itself.
- We sort the indices based on the values in `arr` to ensure we process smaller values first.
- For each index, we attempt to jump both to the right and left within the allowed distance `d`, updating the `dp` array based on valid jumps.
- Finally, we return the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from any index.

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def maxJumps(self, arr: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        dp = [1] * (len(arr) + 1)
        stack = []
        for i, n in enumerate(arr + [1000000]):
            while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < n:
                same_height_idx = [stack.pop()]
                while stack and arr[stack[-1]] == arr[same_height_idx[0]]:
                    same_height_idx.append(stack.pop())
                for j in same_height_idx:
                    # jump to left
                    if i - j <= d:
                        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
                    # jump to right
                    if stack and j - stack[-1] <= d:
                        dp[stack[-1]] = max(dp[stack[-1]], dp[j] + 1)
            stack.append(i)
        return max(dp[:-1])

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] Reflecting on the problem-solving experience, the approach I used was quite similar to the official solution in terms of using dynamic programming to track the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index. However, the official solution introduces a clever use of a stack to efficiently manage the jumps and ensure that the constraints are respected.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Stack Utilization**: The official solution uses a stack to keep track of indices in a way that allows efficient processing of jumps. This is particularly useful for handling the condition that `arr[i] > arr[j]` and ensuring that all elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`.

2. **Handling Equal Heights**: The solution efficiently handles cases where multiple indices have the same height by grouping them together and processing them in one go. This reduces redundant calculations and ensures that the dynamic programming array (`dp`) is updated correctly.

3. **Boundary Management**: By appending a large number (`1000000`) to the array, the solution ensures that all elements in the stack are processed by the end of the loop. This is a neat trick to handle the end of the array without additional checks.

4. **Efficiency**: The use of a stack and the way jumps are processed ensures that the solution is efficient, both in terms of time and space complexity. The stack helps in maintaining a monotonic sequence which simplifies the jump logic.

### Reflection:

The official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to manage the problem constraints effectively. While my approach was correct and passed the test cases, the official solution offers a more elegant and potentially more efficient way to handle the problem, especially for larger inputs. The use of a stack to manage jumps and the handling of equal heights are particularly noteworthy techniques that can be applied to similar problems in the future.

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] The function calculates the maximum number of jumps one can make in an array, where each jump must be to a smaller element within a given distance. It initializes a dynamic programming array to store the maximum jumps possible from each index, starting with a value of 1 for each element. The function sorts the indices of the array based on the values of the elements, ensuring that jumps are considered from smaller to larger elements. For each element, it checks possible jumps to the right and left within the specified distance, updating the dynamic programming array with the maximum jumps possible. The function breaks out of the loop if a jump is not possible due to the constraints. Finally, it returns the maximum value from the dynamic programming array, representing the maximum number of jumps possible from any starting point in the array.

[Problem]
    Given an array ofÂ integers arr and an integer d. In one step you can jump from index i to index:

    i + x where:Â i + x < arr.length and  0 <Â x <= d.
    i - x where:Â i - x >= 0 and  0 <Â x <= d.

    In addition, you can only jump from index i to index jÂ if arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j (More formally min(i,Â j) < k < max(i, j)).
    You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indicesÂ you can visit.
    Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
Â 
    Example 1:

    Input: arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2
    Output: 4
    Explanation: You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.
    Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.
    Similarly You cannot jump from index 3 to index 2 or index 1.
