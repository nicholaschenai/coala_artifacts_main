    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nIndraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are currently in a random order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books. A key observation is that the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books represents the largest subset of books that are already in the correct order. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This is because the books in the LIS do not need to be moved, and all other books need to be repositioned.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of books, `N`, and the current order of books as a list, `books`.\n2. Initialize an empty list, `lis`, to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.\n3. For each book in `books`:\n   - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.\n   - If the position is equal to the length of `lis`, append the book to `lis`.\n   - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.\n4. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n5. The minimum number of moves required is `N - len(lis)`.\n6. Print the result.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef min_moves_to_sort_books():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):\n        low, high = 0, len(lis)\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if lis[mid] < book:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        return low\n    \n    lis = []\n    for book in books:\n        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)\n        if pos == len(lis):\n            lis.append(book)\n        else:\n            lis[pos] = book\n    \n    min_moves = N - len(lis)\n    print(min_moves)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We read the input and parse the number of books and their current order.\n- We define a helper function `binary_search_lis` to find the position where a book can be placed in the `lis` to maintain the increasing order.\n- We iterate over each book and use the helper function to determine where it fits in the `lis`.\n- If the position is at the end of `lis`, we append the book, otherwise, we replace the existing element at that position.\n- The length of `lis` gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n- The minimum number of moves is calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.\n- Finally, we print the result.",
