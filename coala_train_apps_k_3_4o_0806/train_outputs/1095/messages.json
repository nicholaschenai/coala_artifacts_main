The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order.

example\n\n        $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        a &= \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} \\\\\n        d &= \\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\\}\n        \\end{array}$$\n\n        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\}$ or $\\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\\{0, 1\\}$ having length 2.\n\n    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.\n    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.\n\n    So let the current index be $i$.\n    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \\dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.\n    Then there are two options:\n\n    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.\n\n    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.\n        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.\n\n        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.\n        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.\n  \n        $$d[i] = \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(1, \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {\n                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;\n                    p[i] = j;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (d[i] > ans) {\n                ans = d[i];\n                pos = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        vector<int> subseq;\n        while (pos != -1) {\n            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);\n            pos = p[pos];\n        }\n        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());\n        return subseq;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept revolves around dynamic programming and sorting to efficiently determine the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array, given specific jumping constraints. The problem tests the ability to use dynamic programming to track the maximum number of jumps possible from each index, while also leveraging sorting to ensure that jumps are considered in the correct order of values.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**: Using a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. This approach allows us to build up solutions incrementally.\n    2. **Sorting by Value**: Sorting indices based on the values in the array ensures that when processing an index, all potential jumps to lower values have already been considered. This is crucial for correctly updating the `dp` array.\n    3. **Iterative Jump Checking**: For each index, checking possible jumps both to the right and left within the allowed distance `d`, and updating the `dp` array based on valid jumps.\n\n    The solution was implemented successfully without encountering significant errors, and the approach was validated by passing all test cases. This problem reinforced the importance of combining sorting with dynamic programming to solve complex jumping problems efficiently. The key takeaway is the effective use of sorting to manage dependencies in dynamic programming problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Dynamic programming\n    Section: Longest increasing subsequence\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Longest increasing subsequence}\n\n    \\index{longest increasing subsequence}\n\n    Our first problem is to find the\n    \\key{longest increasing subsequence}\n    in an array of $n$ elements.\n    This is a maximum-length\n    sequence of array elements\n    that goes from left to right,\n    and each element in the sequence is larger\n    than the previous element.\n    For example, in the array\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$3$};\n\n    \\footnotesize\n    \\node at (0.5,1.4) {$0$};\n    \\node at (1.5,1.4) {$1$};\n    \\node at (2.5,1.4) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,1.4) {$3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,1.4) {$4$};\n    \\node at (5.5,1.4) {$5$};\n    \\node at (6.5,1.4) {$6$};\n    \\node at (7.5,1.4) {$7$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    the longest increasing subsequence\n    contains 4 elements:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (2,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (2,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (4,0) rectangle (5,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (6,0) rectangle (7,1);\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$3$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,-0.25) .. controls (1.75,-1.00) and (2.25,-1.00) ..

The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books. A key observation is that the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books represents the largest subset of books that are already in the correct order. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This is because the books in the LIS do not need to be moved, and all other books need to be repositioned.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Read the number of books, `N`, and the current order of books as a list, `books`.\n2. Initialize an empty list, `lis`, to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.\n3. For each book in `books`:\n   - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.\n   - If the position is equal to the length of `lis`, append the book to `lis`.\n   - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.\n4.

This is a common issue when dealing with standard input/output in competitive programming environments.\n\n### Steps to Fix the Issue\n\n1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` should be called to execute the logic.\n2. **Check Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly from standard input and processed as expected.\n3. **Output the Result**: Make sure the result is printed to standard output.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nTo address these issues, we need to ensure that the function is called and that the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the revised solution:\n\n```python\ndef min_moves_to_sort_books():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):\n        low, high = 0, len(lis)\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if lis[mid] < book:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        return low\n    \n    lis = []\n    for book in books:\n        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)\n        if pos == len(lis):\n            lis.append(book)\n        else:\n            lis[pos] = book\n    \n    min_moves = N - len(lis)\n    print(min_moves)\n\n# Call the function to execute the solution\nmin_moves_to_sort_books()\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Function Call**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.\n- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings, which are then processed to extract the number of books and their current order.\n- **Output**: The result is printed directly to standard output, which is expected in competitive programming environments.\n\nThese changes should ensure that the solution reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept revolves around dynamic programming and sorting to efficiently determine the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array, given specific jumping constraints. The problem tests the ability to use dynamic programming to track the maximum number of jumps possible from each index, while also leveraging sorting to ensure that jumps are considered in the correct order of values.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**: Using a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. This approach allows us to build up solutions incrementally.\n    2. **Sorting by Value**: Sorting indices based on the values in the array ensures that when processing an index, all potential jumps to lower values have already been considered. This is crucial for correctly updating the `dp` array.\n    3. **Iterative Jump Checking**: For each index, checking possible jumps both to the right and left within the allowed distance `d`, and updating the `dp` array based on valid jumps.\n\n    The solution was implemented successfully without encountering significant errors, and the approach was validated by passing all test cases. This problem reinforced the importance of combining sorting with dynamic programming to solve complex jumping problems efficiently. The key takeaway is the effective use of sorting to manage dependencies in dynamic programming problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. My initial approach used a dynamic programming array to track possible sums, which is a common technique for partition problems.\n\n    The official solution, however, uses a set to track possible sums, which is a more elegant and concise approach. Here's a breakdown of the official solution:\n\n    1. **Initialization**: Start with a set `dp` containing only the sum `0`. This set will be used to track all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones.\n\n    2. **Iterate through stones**: For each stone, update the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in `dp`. This is done using set comprehension, which efficiently updates the set with new possible sums.\n\n    3. **Calculate the result**: After processing all stones, the set `dp` contains all possible sums. The goal is to find the sum that, when doubled and subtracted from the total weight, gives the smallest possible result. This is achieved by iterating through the set and calculating the minimum of `abs(total - 2 * _sum)` for each `_sum` in `dp`.\n\n    The official solution is insightful because it leverages Python's set operations to efficiently manage and update possible sums, resulting in a more concise and potentially faster implementation compared to the traditional dynamic programming array approach. This solution is particularly elegant in its use of set comprehension to handle the sum updates in a single line, making the code both compact and easy to understand.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    Reflecting on the problem-solving experience, the approach I used was quite similar to the official solution in terms of using dynamic programming to track the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index. However, the official solution introduces a clever use of a stack to efficiently manage the jumps and ensure that the constraints are respected.\n\n    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n    1. **Stack Utilization**: The official solution uses a stack to keep track of indices in a way that allows efficient processing of jumps. This is particularly useful for handling the condition that `arr[i] > arr[j]` and ensuring that all elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`.\n\n    2. **Handling Equal Heights**: The solution efficiently handles cases where multiple indices have the same height by grouping them together and processing them in one go. This reduces redundant calculations and ensures that the dynamic programming array (`dp`) is updated correctly.\n\n    3. **Boundary Management**: By appending a large number (`1000000`) to the array, the solution ensures that all elements in the stack are processed by the end of the loop. This is a neat trick to handle the end of the array without additional checks.\n\n    4. **Efficiency**: The use of a stack and the way jumps are processed ensures that the solution is efficient, both in terms of time and space complexity. The stack helps in maintaining a monotonic sequence which simplifies the jump logic.\n\n    ### Reflection:\n\n    The official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to manage the problem constraints effectively. While my approach was correct and passed the test cases, the official solution offers a more elegant and potentially more efficient way to handle the problem, especially for larger inputs. The use of a stack to manage jumps and the handling of equal heights are particularly noteworthy techniques that can be applied to similar problems in the future.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The key insight was that the books already in the correct order form the LIS, and the rest need to be moved. Thus, the minimum moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.\n\n### Core Concepts and Patterns\n- **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: This problem leverages the LIS to identify the maximum subset of books that are already in the correct order. The length of the LIS helps determine how many books are already sorted.\n- **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the position to insert each book in the LIS, a binary search is used. This ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.\n\n### Strategies and Fixes\n- **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. Ensuring the function is executed by calling it at the end of the script fixed this issue.\n- **Efficient LIS Calculation**: Using a binary search to maintain the LIS allowed the solution to handle the upper constraint of 200,000 books efficiently.\n\n### Code Snippet\nHere's the core logic for calculating the minimum moves using the LIS:\n\n```python\ndef min_moves_to_sort_books():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))\n    \n    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):\n        low, high = 0, len(lis)\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if lis[mid] < book:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        return low\n    \n    lis = []\n    for book in books:\n        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)\n        if pos == len(lis):\n            lis.append(book)\n        else:\n            lis[pos] = book\n    \n    min_moves = N - len(lis)\n    print(min_moves)\n\nmin_moves_to_sort_books()\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of correctly handling input/output in competitive programming and the utility of the LIS in solving sorting-related problems efficiently."

        "content": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem of sorting books with the minimum number of moves can be effectively solved by identifying the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement. The official solution and my approach both leverage this concept, but they differ in implementation details.\n\n#### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach to find the LIS. It maintains an array `l` where `l[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. This is a classic approach to solving the LIS problem with a time complexity of \\(O(N^2)\\).\n\n2. **Early Exit for Sorted Array**: The official solution includes a quick check to see if the array is already sorted, which allows for an immediate return of `0` moves. This is a simple yet effective optimization.\n\n3. **Comparison with My Approach**: My approach used a binary search method to maintain the LIS, which is more efficient with a time complexity of \\(O(N \\log N)\\). This is achieved by using a helper function to find the correct position to insert each book in the LIS. This method is more suitable for larger inputs due to its better time complexity.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\n- **Efficiency Considerations**: While both solutions are correct, the choice of algorithm can significantly impact performance, especially for large inputs. The binary search approach is more efficient for larger datasets, which is crucial given the problem's constraints.\n\n- **Input Handling**: Ensuring that the function is called and input/output is handled correctly is essential in competitive programming environments. This was a key issue in my initial solution attempt.\n\n- **Problem-Solving Strategy**: Understanding the problem's core requirement (finding the LIS) and translating it into an efficient algorithm is critical. Both solutions effectively use the LIS concept, but the implementation details can vary based on performance needs.\n\nOverall, this exercise reinforced the importance of choosing the right algorithm for the problem at hand and ensuring that the solution is correctly integrated with the input/output handling expected in a competitive programming context."
