INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are not in order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick up any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. This is because the books in this subsequence do not need to be moved. The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of this longest subsequence.

1. **Identify the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** The longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order is the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) of the given permutation.
2. **Calculate Moves:** The minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of books, `N`.
2. Read the list of books as a permutation.
3. Initialize an empty list `lis` to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.
4. For each book in the permutation:
   - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can replace an element to maintain the increasing order.
   - If the book is larger than all elements in `lis`, append it to `lis`.
   - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.
5. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
6. The minimum number of moves is `N - len(lis)`.
7. Print the result.

### Python Code

```python
def min_moves_to_sort_books():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    # Function to find the position to replace in LIS using binary search
    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < book:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
    
    # Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence
    lis = []
    for book in books:
        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
        if pos < len(lis):
            lis[pos] = book
        else:
            lis.append(book)
    
    # Minimum moves is total books minus the length of LIS
    min_moves = N - len(lis)
    print(min_moves)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We read the input and parse the number of books and their current order.
- We define a helper function `binary_search_lis` to find the correct position in the `lis` list where a book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.
- We iterate over each book, using binary search to determine where it fits in the `lis`. If it fits within the current `lis`, we replace the element at that position. If it is larger than all current elements, we append it.
- The length of `lis` gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
- The minimum number of moves required is the total number of books minus the length of this subsequence, which we then print.

    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }
[/Textbook Reference Material]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept revolves around dynamic programming and sorting to efficiently determine the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array, given specific jumping constraints. The problem tests the ability to use dynamic programming to track the maximum number of jumps possible from each index, while also leveraging sorting to ensure that jumps are considered in the correct order of values.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**: Using a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. This approach allows us to build up solutions incrementally.
    2. **Sorting by Value**: Sorting indices based on the values in the array ensures that when processing an index, all potential jumps to lower values have already been considered. This is crucial for correctly updating the `dp` array.
    3. **Iterative Jump Checking**: For each index, checking possible jumps both to the right and left within the allowed distance `d`, and updating the `dp` array based on valid jumps.

    The solution was implemented successfully without encountering significant errors, and the approach was validated by passing all test cases. This problem reinforced the importance of combining sorting with dynamic programming to solve complex jumping problems efficiently. The key takeaway is the effective use of sorting to manage dependencies in dynamic programming problems.

    Let $\texttt{length}(k)$ denote
    the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position $k$.
    Thus, if we calculate all values of
    $\texttt{length}(k)$ where $0 \le k \le n-1$,
    we will find out the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence.
    For example, the values of the function
    for the above array are as follows:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{length}(0) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(4) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{length}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(6) & = & 4 \\
    \texttt{length}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{length}(6)=4$,
    because the longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position 6 consists of 4 elements.

    To calculate a value of $\texttt{length}(k)$,
    we should find a position $i<k$
    for which $\texttt{array}[i]<\texttt{array}[k]$
    and $\texttt{length}(i)$ is as large as possible.
    Then we know that
    $\texttt{length}(k)=\texttt{length}(i)+1$,
    because this is an optimal way to add
    $\texttt{array}[k]$ to a subsequence.
    However, if there is no such position $i$,
    then $\texttt{length}(k)=1$,
    which means that the subsequence only contains
    $\texttt{array}[k]$.

    Since all values of the function can be calculated
    from its smaller values,
    we can use dynamic programming.
    In the following code, the values
    of the function will be stored in an array
    $\texttt{length}$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        length[k] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (array[i] < array[k]) {
                length[k] = max(length[k],length[i]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    This code works in $O(n^2)$ time,
    because it consists of two nested loops.
    However, it is also possible to implement
    the dynamic programming calculation
    more efficiently in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    Can you find a way to do this?

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are currently in a random order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books. A key observation is that the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books represents the largest subset of books that are already in the correct order. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This is because the books in the LIS do not need to be moved, and all other books need to be repositioned.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of books, `N`, and the current order of books as a list, `books`.
2. Initialize an empty list, `lis`, to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.
3. For each book in `books`:
   - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.
   - If the position is equal to the length of `lis`, append the book to `lis`.
   - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.
4. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
5. The minimum number of moves required is `N - len(lis)`.
6. Print the result.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def min_moves_to_sort_books():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < book:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
    
    lis = []
    for book in books:
        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
        if pos == len(lis):
            lis.append(book)
        else:
            lis[pos] = book
    
    min_moves = N - len(lis)
    print(min_moves)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We read the input and parse the number of books and their current order.
- We define a helper function `binary_search_lis` to find the position where a book can be placed in the `lis` to maintain the increasing order.
- We iterate over each book and use the helper function to determine where it fits in the `lis`.
- If the position is at the end of `lis`, we append the book, otherwise, we replace the existing element at that position.
- The length of `lis` gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
- The minimum number of moves is calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.
- Finally, we print the result.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Output:-----
A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.
- You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.

-----Sample Input-----
5

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The problem with the current solution is likely related to how the input is being read and processed. The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads from standard input and processes the data is never executed. This is a common issue when dealing with standard input/output in competitive programming environments.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` should be called to execute the logic.
2. **Check Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly from standard input and processed as expected.
3. **Output the Result**: Make sure the result is printed to standard output.

### Revised Solution

To address these issues, we need to ensure that the function is called and that the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the revised solution:

```python
def min_moves_to_sort_books():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < book:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
    
    lis = []
    for book in books:
        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
        if pos == len(lis):
            lis.append(book)
        else:
            lis[pos] = book
    
    min_moves = N - len(lis)
    print(min_moves)

# Call the function to execute the solution
min_moves_to_sort_books()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings, which are then processed to extract the number of books and their current order.
- **Output**: The result is printed directly to standard output, which is expected in competitive programming environments.

These changes should ensure that the solution reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result.

Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are currently in a random order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books. A key observation is that the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books represents the largest subset of books that are already in the correct order. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This is because the books in the LIS do not need to be moved, and all other books need to be repositioned.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of books, `N`, and the current order of books as a list, `books`.
2. Initialize an empty list, `lis`, to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.
3. For each book in `books`:
   - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.
   - If the position is equal to the length of `lis`, append the book to `lis`.
   - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.
4. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
5. The minimum number of moves required is `N - len(lis)`.
6. Print the result.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def min_moves_to_sort_books():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < book:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
    
    lis = []
    for book in books:
        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
        if pos == len(lis):
            lis.append(book)
        else:
            lis[pos] = book
    
    min_moves = N - len(lis)
    print(min_moves)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We read the input and parse the number of books and their current order.
- We define a helper function `binary_search_lis` to find the position where a book can be placed in the `lis` to maintain the increasing order.
- We iterate over each book and use the helper function to determine where it fits in the `lis`.
- If the position is at the end of `lis`, we append the book, otherwise, we replace the existing element at that position.
- The length of `lis` gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
- The minimum number of moves is calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.
- Finally, we print the result.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The problem with the current solution is likely related to how the input is being read and processed. The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads from standard input and processes the data is never executed. This is a common issue when dealing with standard input/output in competitive programming environments.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` should be called to execute the logic.
2. **Check Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly from standard input and processed as expected.
3. **Output the Result**: Make sure the result is printed to standard output.

### Revised Solution

To address these issues, we need to ensure that the function is called and that the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the revised solution:

```python
def min_moves_to_sort_books():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < book:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
    
    lis = []
    for book in books:
        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
        if pos == len(lis):
            lis.append(book)
        else:
            lis[pos] = book
    
    min_moves = N - len(lis)
    print(min_moves)

# Call the function to execute the solution
min_moves_to_sort_books()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings, which are then processed to extract the number of books and their current order.
- **Output**: The result is printed directly to standard output, which is expected in competitive programming environments.

These changes should ensure that the solution reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept revolves around dynamic programming and sorting to efficiently determine the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array, given specific jumping constraints. The problem tests the ability to use dynamic programming to track the maximum number of jumps possible from each index, while also leveraging sorting to ensure that jumps are considered in the correct order of values.

    The successful strategy involved:
    1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**: Using a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`. This approach allows us to build up solutions incrementally.
    2. **Sorting by Value**: Sorting indices based on the values in the array ensures that when processing an index, all potential jumps to lower values have already been considered. This is crucial for correctly updating the `dp` array.
    3. **Iterative Jump Checking**: For each index, checking possible jumps both to the right and left within the allowed distance `d`, and updating the `dp` array based on valid jumps.

    The solution was implemented successfully without encountering significant errors, and the approach was validated by passing all test cases. This problem reinforced the importance of combining sorting with dynamic programming to solve complex jumping problems efficiently. The key takeaway is the effective use of sorting to manage dependencies in dynamic programming problems.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The problem of finding the smallest possible weight of the last stone after smashing them together is essentially a partition problem. The goal is to split the stones into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. My initial approach used a dynamic programming array to track possible sums, which is a common technique for partition problems.

    The official solution, however, uses a set to track possible sums, which is a more elegant and concise approach. Here's a breakdown of the official solution:

    1. **Initialization**: Start with a set `dp` containing only the sum `0`. This set will be used to track all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones.

    2. **Iterate through stones**: For each stone, update the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in `dp`. This is done using set comprehension, which efficiently updates the set with new possible sums.

    3. **Calculate the result**: After processing all stones, the set `dp` contains all possible sums. The goal is to find the sum that, when doubled and subtracted from the total weight, gives the smallest possible result. This is achieved by iterating through the set and calculating the minimum of `abs(total - 2 * _sum)` for each `_sum` in `dp`.

    The official solution is insightful because it leverages Python's set operations to efficiently manage and update possible sums, resulting in a more concise and potentially faster implementation compared to the traditional dynamic programming array approach. This solution is particularly elegant in its use of set comprehension to handle the sum updates in a single line, making the code both compact and easy to understand.
[/Reflection]


[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving experience, the approach I used was quite similar to the official solution in terms of using dynamic programming to track the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index. However, the official solution introduces a clever use of a stack to efficiently manage the jumps and ensure that the constraints are respected.

    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

    1. **Stack Utilization**: The official solution uses a stack to keep track of indices in a way that allows efficient processing of jumps. This is particularly useful for handling the condition that `arr[i] > arr[j]` and ensuring that all elements between `i` and `j` are less than `arr[i]`.

    2. **Handling Equal Heights**: The solution efficiently handles cases where multiple indices have the same height by grouping them together and processing them in one go. This reduces redundant calculations and ensures that the dynamic programming array (`dp`) is updated correctly.

    3. **Boundary Management**: By appending a large number (`1000000`) to the array, the solution ensures that all elements in the stack are processed by the end of the loop. This is a neat trick to handle the end of the array without additional checks.

    4. **Efficiency**: The use of a stack and the way jumps are processed ensures that the solution is efficient, both in terms of time and space complexity. The stack helps in maintaining a monotonic sequence which simplifies the jump logic.

    ### Reflection:

    The official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to manage the problem constraints effectively. While my approach was correct and passed the test cases, the official solution offers a more elegant and potentially more efficient way to handle the problem, especially for larger inputs. The use of a stack to manage jumps and the handling of equal heights are particularly noteworthy techniques that can be applied to similar problems in the future.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books. A key observation is that the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books represents the largest subset of books that are already in the correct order. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This is because the books in the LIS do not need to be moved, and all other books need to be repositioned.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of books, `N`, and the current order of books as a list, `books`.
2. Initialize an empty list, `lis`, to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.
3. For each book in `books`:
   - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.
   - If the position is equal to the length of `lis`, append the book to `lis`.
   - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.
4. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
5. The minimum number of moves required is `N - len(lis)`.
6. Print the result.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def min_moves_to_sort_books():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < book:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
    
    lis = []
    for book in books:
        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
        if pos == len(lis):
            lis.append(book)
        else:
            lis[pos] = book
    
    min_moves = N - len(lis)
    print(min_moves)

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We read the input and parse the number of books and their current order.
- We define a helper function `binary_search_lis` to find the position where a book can be placed in the `lis` to maintain the increasing order.
- We iterate over each book and use the helper function to determine where it fits in the `lis`.
- If the position is at the end of `lis`, we append the book, otherwise, we replace the existing element at that position.
- The length of `lis` gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
- The minimum number of moves is calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.
- Finally, we print the result.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The problem with the current solution is likely related to how the input is being read and processed. The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads from standard input and processes the data is never executed. This is a common issue when dealing with standard input/output in competitive programming environments.

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Ensure the Function is Called**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` should be called to execute the logic.
2. **Check Input Handling**: Ensure that the input is read correctly from standard input and processed as expected.
3. **Output the Result**: Make sure the result is printed to standard output.

### Revised Solution

To address these issues, we need to ensure that the function is called and that the input/output is handled correctly. Here's the revised solution:

```python
def min_moves_to_sort_books():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < book:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
    
    lis = []
    for book in books:
        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
        if pos == len(lis):
            lis.append(book)
        else:
            lis[pos] = book
    
    min_moves = N - len(lis)
    print(min_moves)

# Call the function to execute the solution
min_moves_to_sort_books()
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Function Call**: The function `min_moves_to_sort_books()` is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed.
- **Input Handling**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()` and split into a list of strings, which are then processed to extract the number of books and their current order.
- **Output**: The result is printed directly to standard output, which is expected in competitive programming environments.

These changes should ensure that the solution reads from standard input, processes the data, and outputs the correct result.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a sequence of books using the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The key insight was that the books already in the correct order form the LIS, and the rest need to be moved. Thus, the minimum moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

### Core Concepts and Patterns
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: This problem leverages the LIS to identify the maximum subset of books that are already in the correct order. The length of the LIS helps determine how many books are already sorted.
- **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the position to insert each book in the LIS, a binary search is used. This ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

### Strategies and Fixes
- **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. Ensuring the function is executed by calling it at the end of the script fixed this issue.
- **Efficient LIS Calculation**: Using a binary search to maintain the LIS allowed the solution to handle the upper constraint of 200,000 books efficiently.

### Code Snippet
Here's the core logic for calculating the minimum moves using the LIS:

```python
def min_moves_to_sort_books():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    N = int(data[0])
    books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
    def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < book:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        return low
    
    lis = []
    for book in books:
        pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
        if pos == len(lis):
            lis.append(book)
        else:
            lis[pos] = book
    
    min_moves = N - len(lis)
    print(min_moves)

min_moves_to_sort_books()
```

This experience reinforced the importance of correctly handling input/output in competitive programming and the utility of the LIS in solving sorting-related problems efficiently.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order

Indraneel has a shelf with books numbered from 1 to N, but they are currently in a random order. He wants to sort them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can pick any book and place it at a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books. A key observation is that the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books represents the largest subset of books that are already in the correct order. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This is because the books in the LIS do not need to be moved, and all other books need to be repositioned.

### Pseudocode

1. Read the number of books, `N`, and the current order of books as a list, `books`.
2. Initialize an empty list, `lis`, to keep track of the longest increasing subsequence.
3. For each book in `books`:
   - Use binary search to find the position in `lis` where the current book can be placed to maintain the increasing order.
   - If the position is equal to the length of `lis`, append the book to `lis`.
   - Otherwise, replace the element at the found position with the current book.
4. The length of `lis` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
5. The minimum number of moves required is `N - len(lis)`.
6. Print the result.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem of sorting books with the minimum number of moves can be effectively solved by identifying the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement. The official solution and my approach both leverage this concept, but they differ in implementation details.

#### Key Insights from the Official Solution

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach to find the LIS. It maintains an array `l` where `l[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. This is a classic approach to solving the LIS problem with a time complexity of \(O(N^2)\).

2. **Early Exit for Sorted Array**: The official solution includes a quick check to see if the array is already sorted, which allows for an immediate return of `0` moves. This is a simple yet effective optimization.

3. **Comparison with My Approach**: My approach used a binary search method to maintain the LIS, which is more efficient with a time complexity of \(O(N \log N)\). This is achieved by using a helper function to find the correct position to insert each book in the LIS. This method is more suitable for larger inputs due to its better time complexity.

#### Lessons Learned

- **Efficiency Considerations**: While both solutions are correct, the choice of algorithm can significantly impact performance, especially for large inputs. The binary search approach is more efficient for larger datasets, which is crucial given the problem's constraints.

- **Input Handling**: Ensuring that the function is called and input/output is handled correctly is essential in competitive programming environments. This was a key issue in my initial solution attempt.

- **Problem-Solving Strategy**: Understanding the problem's core requirement (finding the LIS) and translating it into an efficient algorithm is critical. Both solutions effectively use the LIS concept, but the implementation details can vary based on performance needs.

Overall, this exercise reinforced the importance of choosing the right algorithm for the problem at hand and ensuring that the solution is correctly integrated with the input/output handling expected in a competitive programming context.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a sequence of books using the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The key insight was that the books already in the correct order form the LIS, and the rest need to be moved. Thus, the minimum...,

INFO - Updated entry: ### Reflection

The problem of sorting books with the minimum number of moves can be effectively solved by identifying the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement. The official solution and my approach both leverage this concept, but they differ in implementation details.

[Problem]
    Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
    He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
    21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
    Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
    12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
    Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
    12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
    Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

    -----Output:-----
    A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.
    - You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.

    -----Sample Input-----
    5
    2 1 4 5 3 

    -----Sample Output-----
