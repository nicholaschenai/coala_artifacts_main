    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a game of billiards with two players. The game consists of several rounds, and in each round, both players score some points. We need to determine the winner based on the maximum lead achieved by any player at the end of any round. The lead is the difference between the cumulative scores of the two players at the end of each round. The player with the highest lead at any point in the game is the winner.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start by reading the number of rounds.\n   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.\n   - Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the player who achieved it.\n   - For each round, update the cumulative scores of both players.\n   - Calculate the lead for the current round.\n   - If the current lead is greater than the maximum lead recorded so far, update the maximum lead and record the player who achieved it.\n   - After processing all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Read N (number of rounds)\n   Initialize player1_cumulative_score = 0\n   Initialize player2_cumulative_score = 0\n   Initialize max_lead = 0\n   Initialize winner = 0\n\n   For each round from 1 to N:\n       Read scores Si and Ti for player 1 and player 2\n       Update player1_cumulative_score += Si\n       Update player2_cumulative_score += Ti\n       Calculate current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)\n       Determine current_leader = 1 if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score else 2\n       If current_lead > max_lead:\n           Update max_lead = current_lead\n           Update winner = current_leader\n\n   Output winner and max_lead\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_winner_and_lead():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    # Read the number of rounds\n    N = int(data[0])\n    \n    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables\n    player1_cumulative_score = 0\n    player2_cumulative_score = 0\n    max_lead = 0\n    winner = 0\n    \n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(N):\n        # Read scores for player 1 and player 2\n        Si = int(data[index])\n        Ti = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        # Update cumulative scores\n        player1_cumulative_score += Si\n        player2_cumulative_score += Ti\n        \n        # Calculate current lead and determine the current leader\n        if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:\n            current_lead = player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score\n            current_leader = 1\n        else:\n            current_lead = player2_cumulative_score - player1_cumulative_score\n            current_leader = 2\n        \n        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater\n        if current_lead > max_lead:\n            max_lead = current_lead\n            winner = current_leader\n    \n    # Output the winner and the maximum lead\n    print(winner, max_lead)\n\n```",
