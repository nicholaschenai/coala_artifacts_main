## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

For each test case print required answer.

Input:

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N. For each query, we need to determine how many subsets exist where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number `I` to be at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers smaller than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

2. **Remaining Numbers**: After placing `I` at the `K`-th position, the remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the set `{I+1, I+2, ..., N}`. The number of such numbers is `N-I`.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**:
   - Choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers: This is done using combinations, denoted as `C(I-1, K-1)`.
   - Choose any subset of the remaining `N-I` numbers: This is `2^(N-I)` possible subsets.

4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, every calculation should be done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute combinations and powers of 2, precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

### Pseudocode

1. **Precompute Factorials and Inverses**:
   - Compute factorials and their inverses up to the maximum `N` using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverses.

2. **Process Each Test Case**:
   - For each query `(I, K)`, check if `K-1` is greater than `I-1`. If true, the result is 0 because we can't choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1`.
   - Otherwise, compute the result as `C(I-1, K-1) * 2^(N-I) % MOD`.

3. **Output Results**:
   - Print the result for each query.

### Final Python Solution

MOD = 10**9 + 7

def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
    factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    inverse_factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    
    for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
        factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD
    
    inverse_factorial[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)
    
    for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
        inverse_factorial[i] = inverse_factorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD
    
    return factorial, inverse_factorial

def combination(n, k, factorial, inverse_factorial):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % MOD * inverse_factorial[n - k] % MOD

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    max_n = 4000
    factorial, inverse_factorial = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n)
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        Q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            I = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            if K - 1 > I - 1:
                results.append(0)
            else:
                comb = combination(I - 1, K - 1, factorial, inverse_factorial)
                power_of_two = pow(2, N - I, MOD)
                result = comb * power_of_two % MOD
                results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

```

This solution efficiently handles the constraints by precomputing necessary values and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets for each query.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides an efficient way to handle the problem by precomputing factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` up to a certain limit. This approach is insightful because it leverages the fact that factorials grow very quickly, and for any `n` greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` will be zero due to the properties of modular arithmetic.

    Key insights from the official solution:

    1. **Precomputation of Factorials:** The solution precomputes the factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` for all numbers up to `10^6 + 3`. This allows for constant-time retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly speeding up the computation.

    2. **Handling Large `n`:** If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the result is immediately zero because the factorial will include a full cycle of the modulus, making the result zero.

    3. **Efficiency:** By precomputing the factorials, the solution avoids recalculating them for each test case, which is crucial given the constraints where `N` can be as large as `10^18`. This reduces the time complexity for each test case to O(1) after the initial precomputation.

    In contrast, my initial approach recalculated the factorial for each test case, which would be inefficient for large values of `N`. The official solution's use of precomputation and the properties of modular arithmetic provides a more optimal and scalable solution. This experience highlights the importance of recognizing opportunities for precomputation and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify and optimize solutions.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to compute the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at each time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. This results in a factorial-like growth, which can become very large, so the challenge was to compute this efficiently using modular arithmetic.

    The key strategy was to use a loop to compute the product of numbers from `1` to `N`, multiplied by `X`, and take the result modulo `10^6 + 3` at each step to prevent overflow and keep the computation efficient. This approach leverages the properties of modular arithmetic, which allows us to take the modulo at each multiplication step without affecting the final result.

    The solution was implemented in Python, using a function to handle the computation for each test case and reading input directly from standard input for efficiency, given the potentially large number of test cases. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach. This problem reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and factorial-like computations.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        Output:
        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

        ### Problem Restatement
        We are given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N and need to find a permutation such that the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair equals a given integer K. If such a permutation exists, we should output it; otherwise, we should output -1.

        ### Conceptual Solution
        1. **Understanding f(P)**: The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of each consecutive pair in the permutation. For a permutation of size N, this is calculated as:
           \[
           f(P) = \max(p_1, p_2) + \max(p_2, p_3) + \ldots + \max(p_{N-1}, p_N)
           \]

        2. **Constraints and Observations**:
           - The minimum value of f(P) is N-1, which occurs when the permutation is sorted in increasing order.
           - The maximum value of f(P) is the sum of the largest N-1 numbers, which is \(\frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} - 1\).

        3. **Approach**:
           - If K is less than N-1 or greater than the maximum possible sum, output -1.
           - Otherwise, construct a permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

        4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
           - Start with the permutation in decreasing order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
           - Adjust the permutation by swapping elements to decrease the sum to K.

        ### Pseudocode
        ```
        function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
            for each (N, K) in test_cases:
                if K < N-1 or K > (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1:
                    output -1
                else:
                    permutation = [N, N-1, ..., 1]
                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) / 2) - 1
                    i = 0
                    while current_sum > K:
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i+1]:
                            swap permutation[i] and permutation[i+1]
                            current_sum -= 1
                        i += 1
                    output permutation
        ```

        ### Final Python Code
        ```python
        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read

            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                if K < N - 1 or K > (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1:
                    results.append("-1")
                else:
                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                    current_sum = (N * (N + 1) // 2) - 1
                    i = 0
                    while current_sum > K:
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_sum -= 1

            sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

        ```

        ### Explanation
        - We start with the permutation in descending order, which gives the maximum possible sum.
        - We then iteratively swap adjacent elements to reduce the sum until it matches K.
        - This approach ensures that we efficiently find a permutation that satisfies the condition or determine that it's impossible.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(I-1, K-1)\).

3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \(2^{N-I}\) possible combinations.

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

### Pseudocode

```
function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
    factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    for i from 2 to max_n:
        factorials[i] = (factorials[i-1] * i) % mod
    inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod-2, mod)
    for i from max_n-1 down to 1:
        inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod
    return factorials, inverses

function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod

function solve_queries(T, queries, mod):
    max_n = 4000
    factorials, inverses = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod)
    results = []
    for each test case:
        read N and Q
        for each query:
            read I and K
            if K > I:
                results.append(0)
            else:

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.

2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.

4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.

5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.

6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.

7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.

### Potential Issues

- **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.

### Correction

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.

### Corrected Code

```python
def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
    factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
        factorials[i] = (factorials[i - 1] * i) % mod
    inverses[max_n] = pow(factorials[max_n], mod - 2, mod)
    for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):
        inverses[i] = (inverses[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % mod
    return factorials, inverses

def binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n - k] % mod

    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        Q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            I = int(data[index])
            K = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            
            if K > I:
                results.append(0)
            else:
                count_less = binomial_coefficient(I - 1, K - 1, factorials, inverses, MOD)

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(I-1, K-1)\).

3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \(2^{N-I}\) possible combinations.

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

### Pseudocode

```
function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n, mod):
    factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)
    inverses = [1] * (max_n + 1)

    for i from max_n-1 down to 1:
        inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod
    return factorials, inverses

function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod

    max_n = 4000

        read N and Q
        for each query:
            read I and K
            if K > I:
                results.append(0)
            else:

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the mean of the maximum possible scores for students after processing a series of questions with complexity factors. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns
    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.
    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.
    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct fixed this issue.
    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.
    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.

    ### Code Snippet
    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.

    ```python
    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):
        scores = [10] * N
        for i, j, k in questions:
            for student in range(i, j + 1):
                scores[student] *= k
        total_score = sum(scores)
        mean_score = total_score // N
        return mean_score

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            M = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            questions = []
            for _ in range(M):
                i = int(data[index]) - 1
                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
                k = int(data[index + 2])
                index += 3
                questions.append((i, j, k))
            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)
            results.append(result)
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.

[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides an efficient way to handle the problem by precomputing factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` up to a certain limit. This approach is insightful because it leverages the fact that factorials grow very quickly, and for any `n` greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` will be zero due to the properties of modular arithmetic.

    Key insights from the official solution:

    1. **Precomputation of Factorials:** The solution precomputes the factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` for all numbers up to `10^6 + 3`. This allows for constant-time retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly speeding up the computation.

    2. **Handling Large `n`:** If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the result is immediately zero because the factorial will include a full cycle of the modulus, making the result zero.

    3. **Efficiency:** By precomputing the factorials, the solution avoids recalculating them for each test case, which is crucial given the constraints where `N` can be as large as `10^18`. This reduces the time complexity for each test case to O(1) after the initial precomputation.

    In contrast, my initial approach recalculated the factorial for each test case, which would be inefficient for large values of `N`. The official solution's use of precomputation and the properties of modular arithmetic provides a more optimal and scalable solution. This experience highlights the importance of recognizing opportunities for precomputation and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify and optimize solutions.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to compute the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at each time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. This results in a factorial-like growth, which can become very large, so the challenge was to compute this efficiently using modular arithmetic.

    The key strategy was to use a loop to compute the product of numbers from `1` to `N`, multiplied by `X`, and take the result modulo `10^6 + 3` at each step to prevent overflow and keep the computation efficient. This approach leverages the properties of modular arithmetic, which allows us to take the modulo at each multiplication step without affecting the final result.

    The solution was implemented in Python, using a function to handle the computation for each test case and reading input directly from standard input for efficiency, given the potentially large number of test cases. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach. This problem reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and factorial-like computations.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000

-----Example:-----
Input:

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(I-1, K-1)\).

3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \(2^{N-I}\) possible combinations.

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might have gone wrong:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.

2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.

4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.

5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.

6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.

7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.

### Potential Issues

- **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.

### Correction

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called. This can be done by adding a call to `solve_queries()` at the end of the script.

    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] In tackling the problem of finding subsets where a specific number appears at a specific position in a sorted order, the core concept was understanding combinatorial counting. The problem required calculating the number of ways to choose elements such that a given number `I` appears at position `K` in a sorted subset. This involved using binomial coefficients to count combinations and powers of 2 to account for remaining elements.

### Key Concepts:
- **Binomial Coefficients**: Used to determine the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` elements.
- **Powers of 2**: Used to calculate the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I`.
- **Modulo Arithmetic**: Essential for handling large numbers, as results needed to be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Strategies:
- **Precomputation**: Precomputing factorials and their modular inverses was crucial for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.
- **Efficient Input/Output Handling**: Using `sys.stdin.read` and `sys.stdout.write` helped manage large input and output sizes.

### Challenges and Fixes:
- **Function Call**: Initially, the function `solve_queries()` was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by explicitly calling the function at the end of the script.
- **Understanding the Problem**: Ensuring that the logic correctly handled the constraints, such as when `K > I`, was important for producing correct results.

The experience reinforced the importance of precomputation in combinatorial problems and highlighted the need to ensure that all parts of the code are executed, especially in competitive programming environments where input/output handling is critical.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries. Each query asks us to determine the number of subsets in which a specific number `I` appears at a specific position `K` when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a given number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers less than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.

2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1` numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(C(I-1, K-1)\).

3. **Remaining Elements**: After choosing `K-1` numbers less than `I`, the rest of the subset can be any combination of the numbers greater than `I`. There are `N-I` such numbers, so there are \(2^{N-I}\) possible combinations.

4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.

### Pseudocode

    factorials = [1] * (max_n + 1)

    for i from max_n-1 down to 1:
        inverses[i] = (inverses[i+1] * (i+1)) % mod
    return factorials, inverses

function binomial_coefficient(n, k, factorials, inverses, mod):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    return (factorials[n] * inverses[k] % mod) * inverses[n-k] % mod

This code should now correctly read input, process each test case, and output the results as expected. The main issue was that the function `solve_queries()` was not being called, which has now been fixed.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process

The problem required calculating the number of subsets where a specific element appears at a specific position in a sorted subset. The challenge was to efficiently compute this for large inputs, given the constraints.

#### Key Insights:

1. **Combinatorial Counting**: The problem boils down to combinatorial counting. For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`. This is a classic binomial coefficient problem, which can be computed using precomputed factorials and their inverses.

2. **Efficient Computation**: The official solution uses a direct computation of binomial coefficients without precomputation, which is feasible for smaller values of `N` and `K`. However, for larger values, precomputing factorials and using modular arithmetic is more efficient, as seen in my approach.

3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is crucial for avoiding overflow and ensuring the results fit within standard data types.

4. **Precomputation vs. On-the-fly Calculation**: My approach precomputes factorials and their inverses, which is beneficial for handling multiple queries efficiently. The official solution calculates binomial coefficients on-the-fly, which can be simpler but potentially less efficient for large inputs.

#### Lessons Learned:

- **Precomputation**: When dealing with combinatorial problems, precomputing factorials and their inverses can significantly speed up calculations, especially when multiple queries are involved.

- **Handling Edge Cases**: Always consider edge cases, such as when `K > I`, which should immediately return zero as no valid subset can exist.

- **Function Calls**: Ensure that the main function is called to execute the solution, as missing this can lead to no output being generated.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations and the use of modular arithmetic in competitive programming. The official solution provided a straightforward approach, while my solution focused on efficiency for larger inputs.

[Problem]
    Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
    number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
    The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
    - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case print required answer.

    -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
    - 1<=T<=5
    - 1<=N, K<=4000
    - 1<=Q<=1000000
    Subtask 3: 5 points
    - 1<=T<=5
    - 1<=N, K<=16
    - 1<=Q<=1000
    Subtask 1: 25 points
    - T=1
    - 1<=N, K<=4000
    - 1<=Q<=100000
    Subtask 2: 70 points
    - Original Constraints.

    -----Example:-----
    Input:

    1

    3 3

    1 2

    2 1

    3 2

    Output:

    0

    2

    2

    -----Explanation:-----
    For N=3

    total subsets are:

    {1}

    {2}

    {3}

    {1,2}

    {1,3}

    {2,3}

    {1,2,3}

    Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

    For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

    Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
