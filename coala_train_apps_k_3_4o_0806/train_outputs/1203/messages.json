For each query, we need to determine how many subsets exist where a specific number `I` appears at the `K`-th position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number `I` to be at the `K`-th position in a sorted subset, there must be exactly `K-1` numbers smaller than `I` in the subset. This means we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`.\n\n2. **Remaining Numbers**: After placing `I` at the `K`-th position, the remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the set `{I+1, I+2, ..., N}`. The number of such numbers is `N-I`.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**:\n   - Choose `K-1` numbers from the `I-1` numbers: This is done using combinations, denoted as `C(I-1, K-1)`.\n   - Choose any subset of the remaining `N-I` numbers: This is `2^(N-I)` possible subsets.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, every calculation should be done modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute combinations and powers of 2, precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible `N`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. **Precompute Factorials and Inverses**:\n   - Compute factorials and their inverses up to the maximum `N` using Fermat's Little Theorem for modular inverses.\n\n2. **Process Each Test Case**:\n   - For each query `(I, K)`, check if `K-1` is greater than `I-1`. If true, the result is 0 because we can't choose `K-1` numbers from `I-1`.\n   - Otherwise, compute the result as `C(I-1, K-1) * 2^(N-I) % MOD`.\n\n3. **Output Results**:\n   - Print the result for each query.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):\n    factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inverse_factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(2, max_n + 1):\n        factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD\n    \n    inverse_factorial[max_n] = pow(factorial[max_n], MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    for i in range(max_n - 1, 0, -1):\n        inverse_factorial[i] = inverse_factorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD\n    \n    return factorial, inverse_factorial\n\ndef combination(n, k, factorial, inverse_factorial):\n    if k > n or k < 0:\n        return 0\n    return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % MOD * inverse_factorial[n - k] % MOD\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    max_n = 4000\n    factorial, inverse_factorial = precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n)\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        Q = int(data[index + 1])\n        index += 2\n        \n        for _ in range(Q):\n            I = int(data[index])\n            K = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            \n            if K - 1 > I - 1:\n                results.append(0)\n            else:\n                comb = combination(I - 1, K - 1, factorial, inverse_factorial)\n                power_of_two = pow(2, N - I, MOD)\n                result = comb * power_of_two % MOD\n                results.append(result)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the constraints by precomputing necessary values and using combinatorial mathematics to determine the number of valid subsets for each query."

This approach is insightful because it leverages the fact that factorials grow very quickly, and for any `n` greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` will be zero due to the properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n    Key insights from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Precomputation of Factorials:** The solution precomputes the factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` for all numbers up to `10^6 + 3`. This allows for constant-time retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly speeding up the computation.\n\n    2. **Handling Large `n`:** If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the result is immediately zero because the factorial will include a full cycle of the modulus, making the result zero.\n\n    3. **Efficiency:** By precomputing the factorials, the solution avoids recalculating them for each test case, which is crucial given the constraints where `N` can be as large as `10^18`. This reduces the time complexity for each test case to O(1) after the initial precomputation.\n\n    In contrast, my initial approach recalculated the factorial for each test case, which would be inefficient for large values of `N`. The official solution's use of precomputation and the properties of modular arithmetic provides a more optimal and scalable solution. This experience highlights the importance of recognizing opportunities for precomputation and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify and optimize solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to compute the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at each time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. This results in a factorial-like growth, which can become very large, so the challenge was to compute this efficiently using modular arithmetic.\n\n    The key strategy was to use a loop to compute the product of numbers from `1` to `N`, multiplied by `X`, and take the result modulo `10^6 + 3` at each step to prevent overflow and keep the computation efficient. This approach leverages the properties of modular arithmetic, which allows us to take the modulo at each multiplication step without affecting the final result.\n\n    The solution was implemented in Python, using a function to handle the computation for each test case and reading input directly from standard input for efficiency, given the potentially large number of test cases. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach. This problem reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and factorial-like computations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).\n        You are given N and an integer K.

This is correct for handling large input sizes efficiently.\n\n2. **Precomputation**: The code precomputes factorials and their modular inverses up to `max_n = 4000`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating binomial coefficients.\n\n3. **Processing Each Test Case**: The code iterates over each test case, reading `N` and `Q` correctly.\n\n4. **Handling Each Query**: For each query, the code reads `I` and `K` and checks if `K > I`. If true, it appends `0` to the results, which is correct.\n\n5. **Calculating Binomial Coefficient**: The code calculates the number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from `I-1` using the precomputed factorials and inverses. This is correct.\n\n6. **Calculating Remaining Combinations**: The code calculates the number of subsets that can be formed with elements greater than `I` using `pow(2, N-I, MOD)`. This is also correct.\n\n7. **Output**: The code appends the result of each query to a list and writes all results at once at the end.\n\n### Potential Issues\n\n- **Function Call**: The function `solve_queries()` is defined but never called. This is likely the reason why no output is detected. The function should be called to execute the logic.\n\n### Correction\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `solve_queries()` function is called.

Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity factor for each question they solve.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns\n    - **Array Manipulation**: The problem required updating scores for a range of students, which is efficiently handled using array operations.\n    - **Input Parsing**: Handling large input efficiently by reading all data at once and parsing it using indices.\n    - **Mean Calculation**: Calculating the mean of scores and using floor division to get the desired result.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the main function was not being called, which resulted in no output. Adding a call to `main()` using the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct fixed this issue.\n    - **Index Management**: Ensuring correct 0-based indexing when parsing input data was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors.\n    - **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently handles up to 100,000 students and questions by iterating over the necessary ranges and using list operations.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The final solution involved defining a `process_test_case` function to handle each test case and a `main` function to manage input/output. The key was ensuring the main function was executed and that input parsing was handled correctly.\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_case(N, M, questions):\n        scores = [10] * N\n        for i, j, k in questions:\n            for student in range(i, j + 1):\n                scores[student] *= k\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N\n        return mean_score\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            M = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            questions = []\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i = int(data[index]) - 1\n                j = int(data[index + 1]) - 1\n                k = int(data[index + 2])\n                index += 3\n                questions.append((i, j, k))\n            result = process_test_case(N, M, questions)\n            results.append(result)\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly managing input/output and ensuring that the main logic of a script is executed, especially in competitive programming and large input scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution provides an efficient way to handle the problem by precomputing factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` up to a certain limit. This approach is insightful because it leverages the fact that factorials grow very quickly, and for any `n` greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the factorial modulo `10^6 + 3` will be zero due to the properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n    Key insights from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Precomputation of Factorials:** The solution precomputes the factorials modulo `10^6 + 3` for all numbers up to `10^6 + 3`. This allows for constant-time retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly speeding up the computation.\n\n    2. **Handling Large `n`:** If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^6 + 3`, the result is immediately zero because the factorial will include a full cycle of the modulus, making the result zero.\n\n    3. **Efficiency:** By precomputing the factorials, the solution avoids recalculating them for each test case, which is crucial given the constraints where `N` can be as large as `10^18`. This reduces the time complexity for each test case to O(1) after the initial precomputation.\n\n    In contrast, my initial approach recalculated the factorial for each test case, which would be inefficient for large values of `N`. The official solution's use of precomputation and the properties of modular arithmetic provides a more optimal and scalable solution. This experience highlights the importance of recognizing opportunities for precomputation and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify and optimize solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept was understanding how to compute the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at each time `t` is `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. This results in a factorial-like growth, which can become very large, so the challenge was to compute this efficiently using modular arithmetic.\n\n    The key strategy was to use a loop to compute the product of numbers from `1` to `N`, multiplied by `X`, and take the result modulo `10^6 + 3` at each step to prevent overflow and keep the computation efficient. This approach leverages the properties of modular arithmetic, which allows us to take the modulo at each multiplication step without affecting the final result.\n\n    The solution was implemented in Python, using a function to handle the computation for each test case and reading input directly from standard input for efficiency, given the potentially large number of test cases. The solution passed all tests, confirming the correctness and efficiency of the approach. This problem reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and factorial-like computations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The challenge was to efficiently compute this for large inputs, given the constraints.\n\n#### Key Insights:\n\n1. **Combinatorial Counting**: The problem boils down to combinatorial counting. For a number `I` to be at position `K` in a sorted subset, we need to choose `K-1` numbers from the set `{1, 2, ..., I-1}`. This is a classic binomial coefficient problem, which can be computed using precomputed factorials and their inverses.\n\n2. **Efficient Computation**: The official solution uses a direct computation of binomial coefficients without precomputation, which is feasible for smaller values of `N` and `K`. However, for larger values, precomputing factorials and using modular arithmetic is more efficient, as seen in my approach.\n\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly handle large numbers by using modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). This is crucial for avoiding overflow and ensuring the results fit within standard data types.\n\n4. **Precomputation vs. On-the-fly Calculation**: My approach precomputes factorials and their inverses, which is beneficial for handling multiple queries efficiently.
