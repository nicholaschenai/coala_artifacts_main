## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Each interval can be colored either blue or yellow. The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs when a part of the X-axis is covered by at least one blue interval and at least one yellow interval. We need to determine a coloring strategy for each test case that maximizes the green length.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green color appears where blue and yellow intervals overlap. Therefore, to maximize the green length, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible between blue and yellow intervals.

2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.

3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color the intervals:
   - Iterate through the sorted intervals.
   - Maintain a running track of the current end of the blue and yellow intervals.
   - For each interval, decide whether to color it blue or yellow based on which choice would result in more overlap with the other color.

4. **Decision Making**: 
   - If the current interval starts after the end of the last blue interval, color it yellow.
   - If the current interval starts after the end of the last yellow interval, color it blue.
   - If it overlaps with both, choose the color that maximizes the overlap with the other color.

5. **Output**: For each test case, output a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.

## Pseudocode

```
function maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case.intervals
        sort intervals by starting point
        blue_end = -1
        yellow_end = -1
        coloring = []
        for each interval in intervals:
            if interval.start > blue_end:
                color it yellow
                update yellow_end
            elif interval.start > yellow_end:
                color it blue
                update blue_end
            else:
                choose color to maximize overlap
                update respective end
            append color to coloring
        append coloring to results
    return results
```

## Python Solution

```python
def maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for intervals in test_cases:
        # Sort intervals by their starting point
        intervals.sort()
        
        # Initialize the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals
        blue_end = -1
        yellow_end = -1
        
        # This will store the coloring result for the current test case
        coloring = []
        
        for L, R in intervals:
            if L > blue_end:
                # If the current interval starts after the last blue interval ends, color it yellow
                coloring.append('1')
                yellow_end = max(yellow_end, R)
            elif L > yellow_end:
                # If the current interval starts after the last yellow interval ends, color it blue
                coloring.append('0')
                blue_end = max(blue_end, R)
            else:
                # If it overlaps with both, choose the color that maximizes overlap
                if blue_end - L < yellow_end - L:
                    coloring.append('0')
                    blue_end = max(blue_end, R)
                else:
                    coloring.append('1')
                    yellow_end = max(yellow_end, R)
        
        # Append the result for this test case
        results.append(''.join(coloring))
    
    return results

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Parse input
index = 0
T = int(data[index])
index += 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    intervals = []
    for _ in range(n):
        L = int(data[index])
        R = int(data[index + 1])
        intervals.append((L, R))
        index += 2
    test_cases.append(intervals)

# Get results
results = maximize_green(T, test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This solution reads input, processes each test case to determine the optimal coloring strategy, and outputs the result for each test case. The approach is efficient and adheres to the constraints provided.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of Pokémon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.

    #### Strategies and Mistakes
    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.

    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.

    ### Code Snippet

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            n, strengths = test_case
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
            alternating_sum = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                else:
                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
            results.append(alternating_sum)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
            test_cases.append((n, strengths))
    
        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

    [Task]:
        Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
        Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
        Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
        Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

        It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

        If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

        -----Input:-----
        - The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
        - The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
        - The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

        -----Output:-----
        - Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
        - The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
        - Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
        - The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $T=10$
        - $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
        - $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
        - Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
        - There can be a color with $0$ ducks

        -----Subtasks-----
        - Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
        - Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
        - Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

        -----Sample Input:-----
        1
        2 4
        3 4 1

        -----Sample Output:-----
        2 1 1 3
        1 1 0 3

        -----Explanation:-----
        - In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
        - The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
        - Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

        ### Problem Restatement

        Salmon has a collection of rubber ducks, each with a specific color. He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.

        2. **Distribution Strategy**:
           - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.
           - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.
           - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.
           - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

        3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
            for each test_case in test_cases:
                N, K = test_case[0]
                duck_counts = test_case[1]
        
                create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts
                sort the list by count in descending order
        
                initialize an empty list for boxes
        
                while there are ducks to place:
                    take the first color with the most ducks
                    if its count is greater than or equal to K:
                        place K ducks of this color in a new box
                        reduce the count of this color by K
                    else:
                        place all ducks of this color in a new box
                        reduce the count of this color to 0
                        fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color
                        reduce the count of the second color accordingly
            
                    add the box configuration to the boxes list
        
                output the boxes list for the current test case
        ```

                color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]
                color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

You are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Each interval can be colored either blue or yellow. The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs where blue and yellow intervals overlap. You need to determine a coloring strategy for each interval to achieve this.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green area is formed by overlapping blue and yellow intervals. To maximize the green area, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible.

2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.

3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color intervals:
   - Alternate the coloring of intervals as you iterate through the sorted list. This ensures that consecutive intervals have a high chance of overlapping, thus maximizing the green area.
   - If an interval overlaps with the previous one, color it with the opposite color to ensure overlap.

4. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).

### Pseudocode

```
function maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case
        sort intervals by starting point L_i
        result = []
        current_color = 0  # Start with blue (0)
        
        for each interval in intervals:
            if it overlaps with the previous interval:
                color it with the opposite color
            else:
                color it with the current color
            add the color to the result
            toggle the current color for the next interval
        
        print the result as a string

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

You are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Each interval can be colored either blue or yellow. The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs where blue and yellow intervals overlap. You need to determine a coloring strategy for each interval to achieve this.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green area is formed by overlapping blue and yellow intervals. To maximize the green area, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible.

2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.

3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color intervals:
   - Alternate the coloring of intervals as you iterate through the sorted list. This ensures that consecutive intervals have a high chance of overlapping, thus maximizing the green area.
   - If an interval overlaps with the previous one, color it with the opposite color to ensure overlap.

4. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).

### Pseudocode

```
function maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case
        sort intervals by starting point L_i
        result = []
        current_color = 0  # Start with blue (0)
        
        for each interval in intervals:
            if it overlaps with the previous interval:
                color it with the opposite color
            else:
                color it with the current color
            add the color to the result
            toggle the current color for the next interval
        
        print the result as a string
```

### Final Python Code

```python
def maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for intervals in test_cases:
        # Sort intervals by their starting point
        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])
        result = ['0'] * len(intervals)
        current_color = 0  # Start with blue (0)
        
        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):
            if i > 0:
                # Check overlap with the previous interval
                _, (prev_L, prev_R) = intervals[i - 1]
                if L <= prev_R:
                    # If overlapping, use the opposite color
                    current_color = 1 - current_color
            result[index] = str(current_color)
            # Toggle color for the next interval
            current_color = 1 - current_color
        
        results.append(''.join(result))

        test_cases.append(intervals)
    
    maximize_green(T, test_cases)

### Explanation

- **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points to facilitate checking for overlaps.
- **Coloring Strategy**: The intervals are colored alternately, and if an overlap is detected with the previous interval, the color is toggled to ensure overlap.
- **Output**: The result for each test case is a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.

- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The current approach uses a simple alternating coloring strategy, which doesn't necessarily maximize the green area. The problem lies in the assumption that alternating colors will always lead to maximum overlap, which is not true for all cases. The intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps rather than just alternating colors.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Assumption of Alternating Colors**: The solution assumed that simply alternating colors would maximize the green area. This is incorrect because the intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps.

2. **Overlap Handling**: The solution did not correctly handle cases where multiple intervals overlap in a way that requires more strategic coloring to maximize the green area.

3. **Coloring Logic**: The logic for determining when to switch colors was too simplistic and did not account for the actual overlap lengths.

### Revised Conceptual Solution

1. **Sort Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points.

2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**:
   - Use a greedy approach to color intervals, but with a focus on maximizing overlap.
   - Track the end of the last interval that was colored blue and yellow.
   - For each interval, decide its color based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case
        sort intervals by starting point L_i
        result = []
        last_blue_end = -1
        last_yellow_end = -1
        
        for each interval in intervals:
            if it overlaps more with blue:
                color it yellow
                update last_yellow_end
            else:
                color it blue
                update last_blue_end
            add the color to the result
        
        print the result as a string
```

### Revised Python Code

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The current approach uses a simple alternating coloring strategy, which doesn't necessarily maximize the green area. The problem lies in the assumption that alternating colors will always lead to maximum overlap, which is not true for all cases. The intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps rather than just alternating colors.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Assumption of Alternating Colors**: The solution assumed that simply alternating colors would maximize the green area. This is incorrect because the intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps.

2. **Overlap Handling**: The solution did not correctly handle cases where multiple intervals overlap in a way that requires more strategic coloring to maximize the green area.

3. **Coloring Logic**: The logic for determining when to switch colors was too simplistic and did not account for the actual overlap lengths.

### Revised Conceptual Solution

1. **Sort Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points.

2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**:
   - Use a greedy approach to color intervals, but with a focus on maximizing overlap.
   - Track the end of the last interval that was colored blue and yellow.
   - For each interval, decide its color based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case
        sort intervals by starting point L_i
        result = []
        last_blue_end = -1
        last_yellow_end = -1
        
        for each interval in intervals:
            if it overlaps more with blue:
                color it yellow
                update last_yellow_end
            else:
                color it blue
                update last_blue_end
            add the color to the result
        
        print the result as a string
```

### Revised Python Code

```python
def maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for intervals in test_cases:
        # Sort intervals by their starting point
        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])
        result = ['0'] * len(intervals)
        last_blue_end = -1
        last_yellow_end = -1
        
        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):
            # Determine which color maximizes overlap
            if L <= last_blue_end:

                result[index] = '0'
                last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)
        
        results.append(''.join(result))

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem revolves around maximizing an alternating sum of a subsequence of Pokémon strengths. The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.

    #### Strategies and Mistakes
    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.

    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.

    #### Correct Approach
    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes
    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.

    ### Code Snippet

    ```python
    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            n, strengths = test_case
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
            alternating_sum = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]
                else:
                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]
            results.append(alternating_sum)
        return results

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        index = 0
        t = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
    
        for _ in range(t):
            n = int(data[index])
            q = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
            index += n
            test_cases.append((n, strengths))
    
        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns
    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.

    #### Strategies and Missteps
    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.

    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.

    #### Correct Solution
    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            count = 0
            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N
            k = 1
            while k * k <= N:
                count += 1
                k += 1
            results.append(count)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]
    
        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.
    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.
    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.

    ### Corrected Code:
    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:

    ```python
    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N, K = test_case[0]
            demands = test_case[1]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        test_cases = []
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
            index += N
            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))
        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

You are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Each interval can be colored either blue or yellow. The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs where blue and yellow intervals overlap. You need to determine a coloring strategy for each interval to achieve this.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green area is formed by overlapping blue and yellow intervals. To maximize the green area, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible.

2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.

3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color intervals:
   - Alternate the coloring of intervals as you iterate through the sorted list. This ensures that consecutive intervals have a high chance of overlapping, thus maximizing the green area.
   - If an interval overlaps with the previous one, color it with the opposite color to ensure overlap.

4. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).

### Pseudocode

```
function maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case
        sort intervals by starting point L_i
        result = []
        current_color = 0  # Start with blue (0)
        
        for each interval in intervals:
            if it overlaps with the previous interval:
                color it with the opposite color
            else:
                color it with the current color
            add the color to the result
            toggle the current color for the next interval

### Explanation

- **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points to facilitate checking for overlaps.
- **Coloring Strategy**: The intervals are colored alternately, and if an overlap is detected with the previous interval, the color is toggled to ensure overlap.
- **Output**: The result for each test case is a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The current approach uses a simple alternating coloring strategy, which doesn't necessarily maximize the green area. The problem lies in the assumption that alternating colors will always lead to maximum overlap, which is not true for all cases. The intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps rather than just alternating colors.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Assumption of Alternating Colors**: The solution assumed that simply alternating colors would maximize the green area. This is incorrect because the intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps.

2. **Overlap Handling**: The solution did not correctly handle cases where multiple intervals overlap in a way that requires more strategic coloring to maximize the green area.

3. **Coloring Logic**: The logic for determining when to switch colors was too simplistic and did not account for the actual overlap lengths.

### Revised Conceptual Solution

1. **Sort Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points.

2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**:
   - Use a greedy approach to color intervals, but with a focus on maximizing overlap.
   - Track the end of the last interval that was colored blue and yellow.
   - For each interval, decide its color based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case
        sort intervals by starting point L_i
        result = []
        last_blue_end = -1
        last_yellow_end = -1
        
        for each interval in intervals:
            if it overlaps more with blue:
                color it yellow
                update last_yellow_end
            else:
                color it blue
                update last_blue_end
            add the color to the result
        
        print the result as a string

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts on Interval Coloring Problem

#### Core Concepts and Patterns
The problem revolves around maximizing the overlap (green area) between intervals on the X-axis by coloring them either blue or yellow. The key concept is to strategically color intervals to ensure maximum overlap, which requires understanding and managing interval overlaps effectively.

#### Initial Strategy and Its Flaws
The initial approach was to alternate colors between intervals, assuming this would naturally lead to maximum overlap. This strategy failed because it did not account for the specific overlaps between intervals. Simply alternating colors does not guarantee that overlapping intervals will be colored differently, which is necessary for maximizing the green area.

#### Effective Strategy
The successful strategy involved:
1. **Sorting Intervals**: Sorting intervals by their starting points to facilitate efficient overlap checking.
2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**: Using a greedy approach to color intervals based on their overlap with previously colored intervals. This involved maintaining the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals and choosing the color that maximizes overlap with these.

#### Code Snippet
```python
def maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for intervals in test_cases:
        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])
        result = ['0'] * len(intervals)
        last_blue_end = -1
        last_yellow_end = -1
        
        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):
            if L <= last_blue_end:
                result[index] = '1'
                last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)
            else:
                result[index] = '0'
                last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)
        
        results.append(''.join(result))
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)
```

#### Lessons Learned
- **Importance of Overlap Management**: The problem highlighted the importance of managing overlaps in interval problems, which is a common theme in computational geometry and scheduling problems.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: A greedy approach, when combined with strategic decision-making based on problem-specific constraints, can be very effective.
- **Iterative Refinement**: The process of refining the solution based on feedback and testing different strategies was crucial in arriving at the correct solution.

### Explanation

- **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points to facilitate checking for overlaps.
- **Coloring Strategy**: The intervals are colored alternately, and if an overlap is detected with the previous interval, the color is toggled to ensure overlap.
- **Output**: The result for each test case is a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

The current approach uses a simple alternating coloring strategy, which doesn't necessarily maximize the green area. The problem lies in the assumption that alternating colors will always lead to maximum overlap, which is not true for all cases. The intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps rather than just alternating colors.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Assumption of Alternating Colors**: The solution assumed that simply alternating colors would maximize the green area. This is incorrect because the intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps.

2. **Overlap Handling**: The solution did not correctly handle cases where multiple intervals overlap in a way that requires more strategic coloring to maximize the green area.

3. **Coloring Logic**: The logic for determining when to switch colors was too simplistic and did not account for the actual overlap lengths.

### Revised Conceptual Solution

1. **Sort Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points.

2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**:
   - Use a greedy approach to color intervals, but with a focus on maximizing overlap.
   - Track the end of the last interval that was colored blue and yellow.
   - For each interval, decide its color based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals.

3. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).

### Revised Pseudocode

```
function maximize_green(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        intervals = test_case
        sort intervals by starting point L_i
        result = []
        last_blue_end = -1
        last_yellow_end = -1
        
        for each interval in intervals:
            if it overlaps more with blue:
                color it yellow
                update last_yellow_end
            else:
                color it blue
                update last_blue_end
            add the color to the result
        
        print the result as a string
```

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] ### Reflection

The problem of maximizing the green area by coloring intervals on the X-axis was an interesting challenge that required careful consideration of overlaps. Here's a reflection on the approach and insights gained:

1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The key to solving this problem was understanding how to maximize the overlap between intervals. The green area is formed by overlapping blue and yellow intervals, so the strategy needed to focus on maximizing these overlaps.

2. **Sorting Intervals**: Both my solution and the official solution started by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This is a crucial step as it allows for efficient checking of overlaps and helps in deciding the coloring strategy.

3. **Coloring Strategy**: The official solution uses a more nuanced approach to determine the coloring:
   - It maintains a `maxi` variable to track the maximum endpoint of the intervals processed so far.
   - It uses a `c` variable to toggle colors when necessary, ensuring that overlaps are maximized.
   - The solution checks if the current interval can be colored to maximize overlap with the previous intervals, and toggles the color if needed.

4. **Comparison with My Approach**: My initial approach was too simplistic, relying on alternating colors without considering the specific overlaps. The official solution's use of `maxi` and `c` to dynamically adjust the coloring based on actual overlaps is more effective.

5. **Key Insight**: The main insight is the use of a dynamic coloring strategy that adapts based on the current state of overlaps. This ensures that the green area is maximized by strategically choosing when to toggle colors.

This problem reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and using a dynamic approach to handle overlaps effectively. The official solution's use of toggling and tracking maximum endpoints is a valuable technique for similar interval-based problems.

[Problem]
    You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
    - White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
    - Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
    - Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
    - Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
    You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
    - The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

    -----Output:-----
    For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
    - $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
    - The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
    - $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    3
    3 7
    2 5
    6 9

    -----Sample Output:-----
    100

    -----Explanation:-----
    The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
    - $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
    - $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
    - $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
    - Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
    Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
    Note that 011 is also a valid output.
