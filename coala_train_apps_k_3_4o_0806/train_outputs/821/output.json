    "raw_msg": "To address the issue with the previous solution, we need to focus on maximizing the overlap between intervals by strategically coloring them. The previous approach of simply alternating colors was too simplistic and did not account for the specific overlaps between intervals. Here's a revised solution that aims to maximize the green area by considering overlaps more effectively:\n\n### Revised Python Code\n\n```python\ndef maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n        result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n        last_blue_end = -1\n        last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n            # Determine which color maximizes overlap\n            if L <= last_blue_end:\n                # If it overlaps with the last blue, color it yellow\n                result[index] = '1'\n                last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, color it blue\n                result[index] = '0'\n                last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)\n        \n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        intervals = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            L, R = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n            intervals.append((L, R))\n            index += 2\n        test_cases.append(intervals)\n    \n    maximize_green(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points to facilitate checking for overlaps.\n- **Coloring Strategy**: The intervals are colored based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals. This is done by maintaining the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals.\n- **Output**: The result for each test case is a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.\n\nThis approach should better handle the overlaps and maximize the green area by strategically choosing colors based on the overlap with previously colored intervals.",
