    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nYou are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Each interval can be colored either blue or yellow. The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs where blue and yellow intervals overlap. You need to determine a coloring strategy for each interval to achieve this.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green area is formed by overlapping blue and yellow intervals. To maximize the green area, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible.\n\n2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.\n\n3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color intervals:\n   - Alternate the coloring of intervals as you iterate through the sorted list. This ensures that consecutive intervals have a high chance of overlapping, thus maximizing the green area.\n   - If an interval overlaps with the previous one, color it with the opposite color to ensure overlap.\n\n4. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        intervals = test_case\n        sort intervals by starting point L_i\n        result = []\n        current_color = 0  # Start with blue (0)\n        \n        for each interval in intervals:\n            if it overlaps with the previous interval:\n                color it with the opposite color\n            else:\n                color it with the current color\n            add the color to the result\n            toggle the current color for the next interval\n        \n        print the result as a string\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n        result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n        current_color = 0  # Start with blue (0)\n        \n        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n            if i > 0:\n                # Check overlap with the previous interval\n                _, (prev_L, prev_R) = intervals[i - 1]\n                if L <= prev_R:\n                    # If overlapping, use the opposite color\n                    current_color = 1 - current_color\n            result[index] = str(current_color)\n            # Toggle color for the next interval\n            current_color = 1 - current_color\n        \n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        intervals = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            L, R = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n            intervals.append((L, R))\n            index += 2\n        test_cases.append(intervals)\n    \n    maximize_green(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points to facilitate checking for overlaps.\n- **Coloring Strategy**: The intervals are colored alternately, and if an overlap is detected with the previous interval, the color is toggled to ensure overlap.\n- **Output**: The result for each test case is a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.",
