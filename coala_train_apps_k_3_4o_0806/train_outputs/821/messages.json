Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:\n- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval\n- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.\n- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.\n- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.\nYou want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.\n- The $i^{\\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $ 1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5 $\n- $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $\n- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n- $ 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n3\n3 7\n2 5\n6 9\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n100\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nThe intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:\n- $[2, 3) \\cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.\n- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.\n- $[3, 5] \\cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.\n- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.\nPlease note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.\nNote that 011 is also a valid output.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Each interval can be colored either blue or yellow. The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs when a part of the X-axis is covered by at least one blue interval and at least one yellow interval. We need to determine a coloring strategy for each test case that maximizes the green length.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green color appears where blue and yellow intervals overlap. Therefore, to maximize the green length, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible between blue and yellow intervals.\n\n2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.\n\n3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color the intervals:\n   - Iterate through the sorted intervals.\n   - Maintain a running track of the current end of the blue and yellow intervals.\n   - For each interval, decide whether to color it blue or yellow based on which choice would result in more overlap with the other color.\n\n4. **Decision Making**: \n   - If the current interval starts after the end of the last blue interval, color it yellow.\n   - If the current interval starts after the end of the last yellow interval, color it blue.\n   - If it overlaps with both, choose the color that maximizes the overlap with the other color.\n\n5. **Output**: For each test case, output a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        intervals = test_case.intervals\n        sort intervals by starting point\n        blue_end = -1\n        yellow_end = -1\n        coloring = []\n        for each interval in intervals:\n            if interval.start > blue_end:\n                color it yellow\n                update yellow_end\n            elif interval.start > yellow_end:\n                color it blue\n                update blue_end\n            else:\n                choose color to maximize overlap\n                update respective end\n            append color to coloring\n        append coloring to results\n    return results\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals.sort()\n        \n        # Initialize the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals\n        blue_end = -1\n        yellow_end = -1\n        \n        # This will store the coloring result for the current test case\n        coloring = []\n        \n        for L, R in intervals:\n            if L > blue_end:\n                # If the current interval starts after the last blue interval ends, color it yellow\n                coloring.append('1')\n                yellow_end = max(yellow_end, R)\n            elif L > yellow_end:\n                # If the current interval starts after the last yellow interval ends, color it blue\n                coloring.append('0')\n                blue_end = max(blue_end, R)\n            else:\n                # If it overlaps with both, choose the color that maximizes overlap\n                if blue_end - L < yellow_end - L:\n                    coloring.append('0')\n                    blue_end = max(blue_end, R)\n                else:\n                    coloring.append('1')\n                    yellow_end = max(yellow_end, R)\n        \n        # Append the result for this test case\n        results.append(''.join(coloring))\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().split()\n\n# Parse input\nindex = 0\nT = int(data[index])\nindex += 1\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    intervals = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        L = int(data[index])\n        R = int(data[index + 1])\n        intervals.append((L, R))\n        index += 2\n    test_cases.append(intervals)\n\n# Get results\nresults = maximize_green(T, test_cases)\n\n# Print results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis solution reads input, processes each test case to determine the optimal coloring strategy, and outputs the result for each test case.

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            count = 0\n            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= N:\n                count += 1\n                k += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Salmon loves to be a tidy person.

Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.\n        Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box.

He wants to organize these ducks into boxes. Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks, and there are `N` boxes available. The ducks come in `N+1` different colors. The goal is to distribute the ducks into the boxes such that each box contains at most two distinct colors.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, read the number of colors `N`, the capacity `K` of each box, and the list of duck counts for each color.\n\n        2. **Distribution Strategy**:\n           - Use a greedy approach to fill each box with ducks from at most two colors.\n           - Start with the color that has the most ducks and fill the boxes until the count is exhausted or the box is full.\n           - If the box isn't full after using one color, fill the remaining space with ducks from the next available color.\n           - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.\n\n        3. **Output**: For each box, output the two colors and the number of ducks from each color in the box.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n            for each test_case in test_cases:\n                N, K = test_case[0]\n                duck_counts = test_case[1]\n        \n                create a list of tuples (color, count) from duck_counts\n                sort the list by count in descending order\n        \n                initialize an empty list for boxes\n        \n                while there are ducks to place:\n                    take the first color with the most ducks\n                    if its count is greater than or equal to K:\n                        place K ducks of this color in a new box\n                        reduce the count of this color by K\n                    else:\n                        place all ducks of this color in a new box\n                        reduce the count of this color to 0\n                        fill the remaining space in the box with ducks from the next color\n                        reduce the count of the second color accordingly\n            \n                    add the box configuration to the boxes list\n        \n                output the boxes list for the current test case\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for test_case in test_cases:\n                N, K = test_case[0]\n                duck_counts = test_case[1]\n        \n                # Create a list of (color, count) and sort by count descending\n                color_counts = [(i, duck_counts[i]) for i in range(N + 1)]\n                color_counts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n        \n                boxes = []\n        \n                while len(boxes) < N:\n                    # Take the first color with the most ducks\n                    c1, m1 = color_counts[0]\n                    if m1 >= K:\n                        # If we can fill a box with this color alone\n                        boxes.append((c1, K, 0, 0))\n                        color_counts[0] = (c1, m1 -

The goal is to maximize the length of the X-axis that is colored green, which occurs where blue and yellow intervals overlap. You need to determine a coloring strategy for each interval to achieve this.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The green area is formed by overlapping blue and yellow intervals. To maximize the green area, we should aim to have as many overlaps as possible.\n\n2. **Sorting Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This helps in efficiently determining overlaps.\n\n3. **Greedy Coloring**: Use a greedy approach to color intervals:\n   - Alternate the coloring of intervals as you iterate through the sorted list. This ensures that consecutive intervals have a high chance of overlapping, thus maximizing the green area.\n   - If an interval overlaps with the previous one, color it with the opposite color to ensure overlap.\n\n4. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        intervals = test_case\n        sort intervals by starting point L_i\n        result = []\n        current_color = 0  # Start with blue (0)\n        \n        for each interval in intervals:\n            if it overlaps with the previous interval:\n                color it with the opposite color\n            else:\n                color it with the current color\n            add the color to the result\n            toggle the current color for the next interval\n        \n        print the result as a string\n```\n\n### Final Python Code\n\n```python\ndef maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n        result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n        current_color = 0  # Start with blue (0)\n        \n        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n            if i > 0:\n                # Check overlap with the previous interval\n                _, (prev_L, prev_R) = intervals[i - 1]\n                if L <= prev_R:\n                    # If overlapping, use the opposite color\n                    current_color = 1 - current_color\n            result[index] = str(current_color)\n            # Toggle color for the next interval\n            current_color = 1 - current_color\n        \n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        intervals = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            L, R = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n            intervals.append((L, R))\n            index += 2\n        test_cases.append(intervals)\n    \n    maximize_green(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points to facilitate checking for overlaps.\n- **Coloring Strategy**: The intervals are colored alternately, and if an overlap is detected with the previous interval, the color is toggled to ensure overlap.\n- **Output**: The result for each test case is a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval."

The problem lies in the assumption that alternating colors will always lead to maximum overlap, which is not true for all cases. The intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps rather than just alternating colors.\n\n### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n1. **Assumption of Alternating Colors**: The solution assumed that simply alternating colors would maximize the green area. This is incorrect because the intervals need to be colored based on their specific overlaps.\n\n2. **Overlap Handling**: The solution did not correctly handle cases where multiple intervals overlap in a way that requires more strategic coloring to maximize the green area.\n\n3. **Coloring Logic**: The logic for determining when to switch colors was too simplistic and did not account for the actual overlap lengths.\n\n### Revised Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Sort Intervals**: Start by sorting the intervals based on their starting points.\n\n2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**:\n   - Use a greedy approach to color intervals, but with a focus on maximizing overlap.\n   - Track the end of the last interval that was colored blue and yellow.\n   - For each interval, decide its color based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals.\n\n3. **Output**: For each test case, output a string where each character represents the color of the corresponding interval ('0' for blue and '1' for yellow).\n\n### Revised Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        intervals = test_case\n        sort intervals by starting point L_i\n        result = []\n        last_blue_end = -1\n        last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n        for each interval in intervals:\n            if it overlaps more with blue:\n                color it yellow\n                update last_yellow_end\n            else:\n                color it blue\n                update last_blue_end\n            add the color to the result\n        \n        print the result as a string\n```\n\n### Revised Python Code\n\n```python\ndef maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n        result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n        last_blue_end = -1\n        last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n            # Determine which color maximizes overlap\n            if L <= last_blue_end:\n                # If it overlaps with the last blue, color it yellow\n                result[index] = '1'\n                last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, color it blue\n                result[index] = '0'\n                last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)\n        \n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        intervals = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            L, R = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])\n            intervals.append((L, R))\n            index += 2\n        test_cases.append(intervals)\n    \n    maximize_green(T, test_cases)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted by their starting points to facilitate checking for overlaps.\n- **Coloring Strategy**: The intervals are colored based on which color will maximize the overlap with previously colored intervals.\n- **Output**: The result for each test case is a string of '0's and '1's representing the coloring of each interval."

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The key insight is that sorting the strengths in descending order allows us to maximize the sum by adding the largest numbers and subtracting the smaller ones.\n\n    #### Strategies and Mistakes\n    Initially, the strategy was to sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the alternating sum by adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This approach seemed logical but failed to account for the flexibility in choosing any subsequence, which means we can skip elements to maximize the sum.\n\n    The mistake was in assuming a strict alternation based on index position in the sorted list, rather than considering the potential to skip elements that would decrease the sum.\n\n    #### Correct Approach\n    The correct approach involves sorting the strengths in descending order and then iterating through the list, adding elements at even indices and subtracting elements at odd indices. This ensures that the largest values are added first, maximizing the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n    The main error was in the logic of calculating the alternating sum. The solution was corrected by ensuring that the alternating sum is calculated by leveraging the largest available values, sorted in descending order. The implementation was adjusted to handle input/output correctly, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles large input sizes effectively.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    ```python\n    def max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            n, strengths = test_case\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            alternating_sum = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    alternating_sum += strengths[i]\n                else:\n                    alternating_sum -= strengths[i]\n            results.append(alternating_sum)\n        return results\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        index = 0\n        t = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n    \n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(data[index])\n            q = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            strengths = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))\n            index += n\n            test_cases.append((n, strengths))\n    \n        results = max_alternating_sum(t, test_cases)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the flexibility in subsequence selection and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the problem's requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Tiling Problem\n\n    #### Core Concepts and Patterns\n    The problem involves distributing tiles from boxes to completely tile rooms in two houses. Each room in the i-th position has an area of i*i, and the i-th box contains i tiles. The challenge is to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using these tiles, with the constraint that each room in one house is paired with a room in the other house, and both rooms are tiled using tiles from the same box.\n\n    #### Strategies and Missteps\n    Initially, I misunderstood the problem by trying to find the largest `k` such that the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is less than or equal to `N`. This approach was incorrect because it did not align with the requirement of tiling rooms with specific areas using a fixed number of tiles from each box.\n\n    The correct approach is to find the largest integer `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This is because the area of the room is i*i, and we need to find the largest i such that i*i <= N. This i will give us the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n    #### Correct Solution\n    The correct solution involves iterating over each test case and determining how many rooms can be tiled completely by finding the largest `k` such that `k * k <= N`. This approach correctly implements the logic to determine the number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            count = 0\n            # Find the largest k such that k * k <= N\n            k = 1\n            while k * k <= N:\n                count += 1\n                k += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n    \n        count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting problem constraints and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to determine if Gru could distribute all his money to the minions such that he has none left. The core concept was to check if the sum of the money demanded by the minions equals the total money Gru has. If they match, the output should be \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Input Parsing**: The input was provided as a single string, which needed to be split and parsed correctly. This involved reading the number of test cases, and for each test case, reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the list of demands.\n    - **Logic**: The main logic was straightforward: calculate the sum of the demands and compare it to the money Gru has. If they are equal, Gru can distribute all his money.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling**: The primary issue was ensuring that the input was parsed correctly. The input format required careful indexing to extract the correct values for each test case.\n    - **Output**: The results needed to be stored and printed correctly for each test case.\n\n    ### Corrected Code:\n    The final solution involved correctly parsing the input and applying the logic to determine if Gru could distribute all his money. The code snippet below reflects the correct approach:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N, K = test_case[0]\n            demands = test_case[1]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        test_cases = []\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, data[index:index + 2])\n            index += 2\n            demands = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n            index += N\n            test_cases.append(((N, K), demands))\n        can_spend_all_money(T, test_cases)\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input parsing and validation, especially when dealing with competitive programming problems where input formats are strict.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "### Summary of Attempts on Interval Coloring Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem revolves around maximizing the overlap (green area) between intervals on the X-axis by coloring them either blue or yellow. The key concept is to strategically color intervals to ensure maximum overlap, which requires understanding and managing interval overlaps effectively.\n\n#### Initial Strategy and Its Flaws\nThe initial approach was to alternate colors between intervals, assuming this would naturally lead to maximum overlap. This strategy failed because it did not account for the specific overlaps between intervals. Simply alternating colors does not guarantee that overlapping intervals will be colored differently, which is necessary for maximizing the green area.\n\n#### Effective Strategy\nThe successful strategy involved:\n1. **Sorting Intervals**: Sorting intervals by their starting points to facilitate efficient overlap checking.\n2. **Greedy Coloring with Overlap Consideration**: Using a greedy approach to color intervals based on their overlap with previously colored intervals. This involved maintaining the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals and choosing the color that maximizes overlap with these.\n\n#### Code Snippet\n```python\ndef maximize_green(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        intervals = sorted(enumerate(intervals), key=lambda x: x[1][0])\n        result = ['0'] * len(intervals)\n        last_blue_end = -1\n        last_yellow_end = -1\n        \n        for i, (index, (L, R)) in enumerate(intervals):\n            if L <= last_blue_end:\n                result[index] = '1'\n                last_yellow_end = max(last_yellow_end, R)\n            else:\n                result[index] = '0'\n                last_blue_end = max(last_blue_end, R)\n        \n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n```\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n- **Importance of Overlap Management**: The problem highlighted the importance of managing overlaps in interval problems, which is a common theme in computational geometry and scheduling problems.\n- **Greedy Algorithms**: A greedy approach, when combined with strategic decision-making based on problem-specific constraints, can be very effective.\n- **Iterative Refinement**: The process of refining the solution based on feedback and testing different strategies was crucial in arriving at the correct solution."

        "content": "### Reflection\n\nThe problem of maximizing the green area by coloring intervals on the X-axis was an interesting challenge that required careful consideration of overlaps. Here's a reflection on the approach and insights gained:\n\n1. **Understanding Overlaps**: The key to solving this problem was understanding how to maximize the overlap between intervals. The green area is formed by overlapping blue and yellow intervals, so the strategy needed to focus on maximizing these overlaps.\n\n2. **Sorting Intervals**: Both my solution and the official solution started by sorting the intervals based on their starting points. This is a crucial step as it allows for efficient checking of overlaps and helps in deciding the coloring strategy.\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**: The official solution uses a more nuanced approach to determine the coloring:\n   - It maintains a `maxi` variable to track the maximum endpoint of the intervals processed so far.\n   - It uses a `c` variable to toggle colors when necessary, ensuring that overlaps are maximized.\n   - The solution checks if the current interval can be colored to maximize overlap with the previous intervals, and toggles the color if needed.\n\n4. **Comparison with My Approach**: My initial approach was too simplistic, relying on alternating colors without considering the specific overlaps. The official solution's use of `maxi` and `c` to dynamically adjust the coloring based on actual overlaps is more effective.\n\n5. **Key Insight**: The main insight is the use of a dynamic coloring strategy that adapts based on the current state of overlaps. This ensures that the green area is maximized by strategically choosing when to toggle colors.\n\nThis problem reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and using a dynamic approach to handle overlaps effectively. The official solution's use of toggling and tracking maximum endpoints is a valuable technique for similar interval-based problems."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads input data from standard input, which includes a number of test cases, each containing a list of intervals. It processes each test case by sorting the intervals based on their starting points and then assigns a color (either '0' for blue or '1' for yellow) to each interval to maximize the overlap of intervals colored yellow. The function maintains two variables to track the end points of the last blue and yellow intervals. For each interval, it checks if it overlaps with the last blue interval to decide its color, updating the respective end point accordingly. The results for each test case are collected and printed as strings of '0's and '1's, representing the color assignments for the intervals.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to maximize the overlap of two sets of intervals on a line, such as in scheduling problems, resource allocation, or network bandwidth management. The problem involves coloring intervals to maximize the length of overlap between two different colors, which can be applied to any situation where overlapping intervals need to be managed or optimized. The solution involves sorting intervals and making decisions based on the overlap with previously colored intervals, which is a common technique in interval scheduling and optimization problems."
