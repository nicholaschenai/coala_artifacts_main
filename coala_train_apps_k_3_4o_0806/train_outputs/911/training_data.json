    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts on the Golomb Sequence Problem\n\n#### Core Concepts and Patterns\nThe problem revolves around understanding and efficiently computing the Golomb sequence, which is a self-describing sequence. The sequence is defined such that each number n appears exactly G_n times. The challenge is to compute the sum of squares of terms in this sequence over a given range, which requires efficient handling due to potentially large indices (up to \\(10^{10}\\)).\n\n#### Strategies and Challenges\n1. **Precomputation**: Initially, I attempted to precompute the Golomb sequence up to a reasonable limit. This approach is necessary because directly computing the sequence for very large indices is impractical. However, the precomputation limit was set too low, which led to incorrect results for larger ranges.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: I used binary search to find the Golomb value at a given index. This was intended to efficiently determine which number in the sequence corresponds to a given index. However, the logic for determining the range of indices covered by each Golomb number was flawed, leading to incorrect sums.\n\n3. **Index Handling**: The main issue was in handling the indices correctly. The logic for determining the range of indices covered by each Golomb number was not accurately implemented, which resulted in incorrect calculations of the sum of squares.\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n- **Precomputation Limits**: It's crucial to set an appropriate precomputation limit based on the problem constraints. For large ranges, a more dynamic approach or a higher limit might be necessary.\n- **Correct Logic Implementation**: Ensuring that the logic for index handling and range determination is correct is vital. Small errors in these calculations can lead to significant discrepancies in results.\n- **Testing and Debugging**: The feedback loop from testing and debugging is essential. It helps identify where the logic fails and guides necessary corrections.\n\nIn future problems involving sequences or similar constructs, these insights will be valuable in structuring the solution efficiently and correctly.",
    "reflection": "Reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I realized that my approach was fundamentally flawed due to a misunderstanding of how to efficiently handle large ranges in the Golomb sequence. The key insight from the official solution is the use of precomputation and prefix sums to efficiently answer range queries.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation**: The official solution precomputes the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit, similar to my approach. However, it goes further by also precomputing cumulative sums (`prefix_storer`) and cumulative indices (`bin_storer`) which are crucial for efficient range queries.\n\n2. **Efficient Range Queries**: The solution uses a binary search (`find_upper_bound`) to quickly find the relevant segment of the Golomb sequence for any given index. This allows the solution to efficiently compute the sum of squares over a range using precomputed prefix sums.\n\n3. **Handling Large Ranges**: By using prefix sums, the solution can handle very large ranges without recalculating the sum from scratch. This is a significant improvement over my approach, which attempted to calculate sums directly and was inefficient for large ranges.\n\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: The solution carefully applies modulo arithmetic throughout the computation to ensure that results remain within the required limits, which is crucial for handling large numbers.\n\n### Lessons Learned:\n\n- **Prefix Sums and Binary Search**: These are powerful techniques for efficiently handling range queries, especially in sequences like the Golomb sequence where direct computation is infeasible for large indices.\n  \n- **Precomputation Strategy**: Precomputing not just the sequence but also cumulative properties (like sums and indices) can drastically improve the efficiency of solving range-based problems.\n\n- **Understanding Problem Constraints**: It's important to fully understand the constraints and properties of the sequence being dealt with, as this can lead to more efficient solutions.\n\nIn future problems involving sequences and range queries, I will consider these techniques to improve both time and space efficiency.",
