We are given a tree with `N` vertices, where each vertex has an integer value associated with it. We need to determine the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the sequence of integers found along the shortest path from Vertex 1 to each other vertex `k` in the tree. The tree is defined by `N-1` edges connecting the vertices.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list. This will allow us to easily traverse the tree and find paths between vertices.

2. **Path Finding**: Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from Vertex 1 to find the shortest path to each vertex `k`. Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path is unique and can be found using BFS.

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: For each path found from Vertex 1 to `k`, compute the LIS of the sequence of integers on that path. This can be efficiently done using a dynamic programming approach with binary search, which runs in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the path.

4. **Output**: For each vertex `k`, output the length of the LIS of the path from Vertex 1 to `k`.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of vertices `N`, the list of integers `a` associated with each vertex, and the list of edges.

2. Construct an adjacency list for the tree.

3. Initialize a BFS queue starting from Vertex 1 and a list to store the path to each vertex.

4. Perform BFS to find the shortest path from Vertex 1 to each vertex `k`.

5. For each vertex `k`, extract the sequence of integers along the path from Vertex 1 to `k`.

6. Compute the LIS of this sequence using a dynamic programming approach with binary search.

7. Print the length of the LIS for each vertex `k`.

### Python Code

```python
def compute_lis(sequence):
    if not sequence:
        return 0
    lis = []
    for value in sequence:
        pos = binary_search(lis, value)
        if pos == len(lis):
            lis.append(value)
        else:
            lis[pos] = value
    return len(lis)

def binary_search(lis, value):
    low, high = 0, len(lis)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if lis[mid] < value:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low

def find_lis_in_tree():
    import sys

    a = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))
    edges = list(zip(map(int, data[N+1::2]), map(int, data[N+2::2])))
    
    from collections import defaultdict, deque
    
    # Build the adjacency list for the tree
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    
    # BFS to find paths from vertex 1
    paths = {1: [1]}
    queue = deque([1])
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        current_path = paths[current]
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in paths:
                paths[neighbor] = current_path + [neighbor]
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Calculate LIS for each path
    results = []
    for k in range(1, N + 1):
        path = paths[k]
        sequence = [a[i - 1] for i in path]
        lis_length = compute_lis(sequence)
        results.append(lis_length)
    
    # Print results
    for result in results:
        print(result)

find_lis_in_tree()
```

### Explanation

- **Tree Construction**: We use a dictionary to represent the adjacency list of the tree.
- **BFS for Path Finding**: We use a queue to perform BFS and keep track of the path to each vertex.
- **LIS Calculation**: For each path, we compute the LIS using a helper function `compute_lis` which uses binary search to maintain a list of the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of different lengths.
- **Output**: We print the length of the LIS for each vertex from 1 to `N`.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element.

    This approach efficiently computes the LIS length in O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable given the problem constraints. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence problems and provided a clear example of how to implement it effectively.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a sequence of books using the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The key insight was that the books already in the correct order form the LIS, and the rest need to be moved. Thus, the minimum moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: This problem leverages the LIS to identify the maximum subset of books that are already in the correct order. The length of the LIS helps determine how many books are already sorted.
    - **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the position to insert each book in the LIS, a binary search is used. This ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. Ensuring the function is executed by calling it at the end of the script fixed this issue.
    - **Efficient LIS Calculation**: Using a binary search to maintain the LIS allowed the solution to handle the upper constraint of 200,000 books efficiently.

    ### Code Snippet
    Here's the core logic for calculating the minimum moves using the LIS:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort_books():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        N = int(data[0])
        books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
        def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
            low, high = 0, len(lis)
            while low < high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if lis[mid] < book:
                    low = mid + 1
                else:
                    high = mid
            return low
    
        lis = []
        for book in books:
            pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
            if pos == len(lis):
                lis.append(book)
            else:
                lis[pos] = book
    
        min_moves = N - len(lis)
        print(min_moves)

    min_moves_to_sort_books()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly handling input/output in competitive programming and the utility of the LIS in solving sorting-related problems efficiently.
[/Summary]

    ### Reflection

    The problem of sorting books with the minimum number of moves can be effectively solved by identifying the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement. The official solution and my approach both leverage this concept, but they differ in implementation details.

    #### Key Insights from the Official Solution

    1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach to find the LIS. It maintains an array `l` where `l[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. This is a classic approach to solving the LIS problem with a time complexity of \(O(N^2)\).

    2. **Early Exit for Sorted Array**: The official solution includes a quick check to see if the array is already sorted, which allows for an immediate return of `0` moves. This is a simple yet effective optimization.

    3. **Comparison with My Approach**: My approach used a binary search method to maintain the LIS, which is more efficient with a time complexity of \(O(N \log N)\). This is achieved by using a helper function to find the correct position to insert each book in the LIS. This method is more suitable for larger inputs due to its better time complexity.

    #### Lessons Learned

    - **Efficiency Considerations**: While both solutions are correct, the choice of algorithm can significantly impact performance, especially for large inputs. The binary search approach is more efficient for larger datasets, which is crucial given the problem's constraints.

    - **Input Handling**: Ensuring that the function is called and input/output is handled correctly is essential in competitive programming environments. This was a key issue in my initial solution attempt.

    - **Problem-Solving Strategy**: Understanding the problem's core requirement (finding the LIS) and translating it into an efficient algorithm is critical. Both solutions effectively use the LIS concept, but the implementation details can vary based on performance needs.

    Overall, this exercise reinforced the importance of choosing the right algorithm for the problem at hand and ensuring that the solution is correctly integrated with the input/output handling expected in a competitive programming context.

INFO - [Task id] 513 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `N` vertices, where each vertex has an integer value associated with it. The tree is defined by `N-1` edges connecting these vertices. For each vertex `k` from 1 to `N`, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the sequence formed by the values on the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex `k`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list. This will allow us to easily traverse the tree and find paths between vertices.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path between any two vertices is unique. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: For each vertex `k`, once we have the path from vertex 1 to `k`, we need to compute the LIS of the sequence of values on this path. We can use a dynamic programming approach with binary search to efficiently compute the LIS in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the path.

4. **Output**: For each vertex `k`, output the length of the LIS of the path from vertex 1 to `k`.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of vertices `N`, the list of values `a`, and the list of edges.
2. Construct the adjacency list for the tree.
3. Perform a BFS or DFS from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.
4. For each vertex `k`:
   - Retrieve the path from vertex 1 to `k`.
   - Extract the sequence of values on this path.
   - Compute the LIS of this sequence using a dynamic programming approach with binary search.
   - Store the length of the LIS.
5. Print the LIS lengths for each vertex from 1 to `N`.

### Python Code

```python
def find_lis_length(sequence):
    if not sequence:
        return 0
    
    # This will store the smallest ending value of an increasing subsequence of each length

    for value in sequence:
        # Binary search to find the position to replace or extend the LIS
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lis[mid] < value:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        # If low is equal to the length of lis, it means we are extending the LIS
        if low == len(lis):

 ### Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `N` vertices, where each vertex has an integer value associated with it. The tree is defined by `N-1` edges connecting these vertices. For each vertex `k` from 1 to `N`, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the sequence formed by the values on the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex `k`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list. This will allow us to easily traverse the tree and find paths between vertices.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path between any two vertices is unique. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: For each vertex `k`, once we have the path from vertex 1 to `k`, we need to compute the LIS of the sequence of values on this path. We can use a dynamic programming approach with binary search to efficiently compute the LIS in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the path.

4. **Output**: For each vertex `k`, output the length of the LIS of the path from vertex 1 to `k`.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of vertices `N`, the list of values `a`, and the list of edges.
2. Construct the adjacency list for the tree.
3. Perform a BFS or DFS from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.
4. For each vertex `k`:
   - Retrieve the path from vertex 1 to `k`.
   - Extract the sequence of values on this path.
   - Compute the LIS of this sequence using a dynamic programming approach with binary search.
   - Store the length of the LIS.
5. Print the LIS lengths for each vertex from 1 to `N`.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
We have a tree with N vertices, whose i-th edge connects Vertex u_i and Vertex v_i.
Vertex i has an integer a_i written on it.
For every integer k from 1 through N, solve the following problem:
 - We will make a sequence by lining up the integers written on the vertices along the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex k, in the order they appear. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence of this sequence.
Here, the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence A of length L is the subsequence A_{i_1} , A_{i_2} , ... , A_{i_M} with the greatest possible value of M such that 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_M \leq L and A_{i_1} < A_{i_2} < ... < A_{i_M}.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq u_i , v_i \leq N
 - u_i \neq v_i
 - The given graph is a tree.
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N
u_1 v_1
u_2 v_2
:
u_{N-1} v_{N-1}

-----Output-----
Print N lines. The k-th line, print the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the sequence obtained from the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex k.

-----Sample Input-----

[/Environment Feedback]

INFO - [Task id] 513 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 513 [generation text] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the input will not be processed, and no output will be generated. This is likely the reason for the "No output detected" error.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to be run directly, the function should be called at the end of the script to ensure it executes.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format in the feedback seems to be a list of strings, but the code prints integers directly. This discrepancy might be due to the testing environment's expectations, but typically, the output should be printed as integers, one per line.

4. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for finding the LIS and the BFS traversal to find paths seems correct. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify this.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called at the end of the script to trigger the input reading and processing.

2. **Verify Output**: Ensure that the output is printed correctly, one integer per line, as expected by the problem statement.

3. **Test the Code**: After making these changes, test the code with the provided sample input to ensure it produces the correct output.

### Revised Code

Let's make these changes and provide the revised code:

        print(result)

# Call the solve function to execute the solution
solve()
```

This revised code ensures that the `solve()` function is called, which should address the issue of no output being detected.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
We have a tree with N vertices, whose i-th edge connects Vertex u_i and Vertex v_i.
Vertex i has an integer a_i written on it.
For every integer k from 1 through N, solve the following problem:
 - We will make a sequence by lining up the integers written on the vertices along the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex k, in the order they appear. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence of this sequence.
Here, the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence A of length L is the subsequence A_{i_1} , A_{i_2} , ... , A_{i_M} with the greatest possible value of M such that 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_M \leq L and A_{i_1} < A_{i_2} < ... < A_{i_M}.

-----Constraints-----

INFO - [Task id] 513 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `N` vertices, where each vertex has an integer value associated with it. The tree is defined by `N-1` edges connecting these vertices. For each vertex `k` from 1 to `N`, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the sequence formed by the values on the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex `k`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list. This will allow us to easily traverse the tree and find paths between vertices.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path between any two vertices is unique. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: For each vertex `k`, once we have the path from vertex 1 to `k`, we need to compute the LIS of the sequence of values on this path. We can use a dynamic programming approach with binary search to efficiently compute the LIS in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the path.

4. **Output**: For each vertex `k`, output the length of the LIS of the path from vertex 1 to `k`.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of vertices `N`, the list of values `a`, and the list of edges.
2. Construct the adjacency list for the tree.
3. Perform a BFS or DFS from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.
4. For each vertex `k`:
   - Retrieve the path from vertex 1 to `k`.
   - Extract the sequence of values on this path.
   - Compute the LIS of this sequence using a dynamic programming approach with binary search.
   - Store the length of the LIS.
5. Print the LIS lengths for each vertex from 1 to `N`.

### Python Code

INFO - [Task id] 513 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 513 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the input will not be processed, and no output will be generated. This is likely the reason for the "No output detected" error.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to be run directly, the function should be called at the end of the script to ensure it executes.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format in the feedback seems to be a list of strings, but the code prints integers directly. This discrepancy might be due to the testing environment's expectations, but typically, the output should be printed as integers, one per line.

4. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for finding the LIS and the BFS traversal to find paths seems correct. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify this.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called at the end of the script to trigger the input reading and processing.

2. **Verify Output**: Ensure that the output is printed correctly, one integer per line, as expected by the problem statement.

3. **Test the Code**: After making these changes, test the code with the provided sample input to ensure it produces the correct output.

### Revised Code

Let's make these changes and provide the revised code:

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a sequence of books using the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The key insight was that the books already in the correct order form the LIS, and the rest need to be moved. Thus, the minimum moves required is the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns
    - **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: This problem leverages the LIS to identify the maximum subset of books that are already in the correct order. The length of the LIS helps determine how many books are already sorted.
    - **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the position to insert each book in the LIS, a binary search is used. This ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

    ### Strategies and Fixes
    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. Ensuring the function is executed by calling it at the end of the script fixed this issue.
    - **Efficient LIS Calculation**: Using a binary search to maintain the LIS allowed the solution to handle the upper constraint of 200,000 books efficiently.

    ### Code Snippet
    Here's the core logic for calculating the minimum moves using the LIS:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort_books():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        N = int(data[0])
        books = list(map(int, data[1:]))
    
        def binary_search_lis(lis, book):
            low, high = 0, len(lis)
            while low < high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if lis[mid] < book:
                    low = mid + 1
                else:
                    high = mid
            return low
    
        lis = []
        for book in books:
            pos = binary_search_lis(lis, book)
            if pos == len(lis):
                lis.append(book)
            else:
                lis[pos] = book
    
        min_moves = N - len(lis)
        print(min_moves)

    min_moves_to_sort_books()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of correctly handling input/output in competitive programming and the utility of the LIS in solving sorting-related problems efficiently.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If a previous element is smaller, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element.

    This approach efficiently computes the LIS length in O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable given the problem constraints. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence problems and provided a clear example of how to implement it effectively.

    ### Reflection

    The problem of sorting books with the minimum number of moves can be effectively solved by identifying the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement. The official solution and my approach both leverage this concept, but they differ in implementation details.

    #### Key Insights from the Official Solution

    1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach to find the LIS. It maintains an array `l` where `l[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. This is a classic approach to solving the LIS problem with a time complexity of \(O(N^2)\).

    2. **Early Exit for Sorted Array**: The official solution includes a quick check to see if the array is already sorted, which allows for an immediate return of `0` moves. This is a simple yet effective optimization.

    3. **Comparison with My Approach**: My approach used a binary search method to maintain the LIS, which is more efficient with a time complexity of \(O(N \log N)\). This is achieved by using a helper function to find the correct position to insert each book in the LIS. This method is more suitable for larger inputs due to its better time complexity.

    #### Lessons Learned

    - **Efficiency Considerations**: While both solutions are correct, the choice of algorithm can significantly impact performance, especially for large inputs. The binary search approach is more efficient for larger datasets, which is crucial given the problem's constraints.

    - **Input Handling**: Ensuring that the function is called and input/output is handled correctly is essential in competitive programming environments. This was a key issue in my initial solution attempt.

    - **Problem-Solving Strategy**: Understanding the problem's core requirement (finding the LIS) and translating it into an efficient algorithm is critical. Both solutions effectively use the LIS concept, but the implementation details can vary based on performance needs.

    Overall, this exercise reinforced the importance of choosing the right algorithm for the problem at hand and ensuring that the solution is correctly integrated with the input/output handling expected in a competitive programming context.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
We have a tree with N vertices, whose i-th edge connects Vertex u_i and Vertex v_i.
Vertex i has an integer a_i written on it.
For every integer k from 1 through N, solve the following problem:
 - We will make a sequence by lining up the integers written on the vertices along the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex k, in the order they appear. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence of this sequence.
Here, the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence A of length L is the subsequence A_{i_1} , A_{i_2} , ... , A_{i_M} with the greatest possible value of M such that 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_M \leq L and A_{i_1} < A_{i_2} < ... < A_{i_M}.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq u_i , v_i \leq N
 - u_i \neq v_i
 - The given graph is a tree.
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N
u_1 v_1
u_2 v_2
:
u_{N-1} v_{N-1}

-----Output-----
Print N lines. The k-th line, print the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the sequence obtained from the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex k.

-----Sample Input-----
10
1 2 5 3 4 6 7 3 2 4
1 2
2 3

For example, the sequence A obtained from the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex 5 is 1,2,5,3,4. Its longest increasing subsequence is A_1, A_2, A_4, A_5, with the length of 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 513 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `N` vertices, where each vertex has an integer value associated with it. The tree is defined by `N-1` edges connecting these vertices. For each vertex `k` from 1 to `N`, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the sequence formed by the values on the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex `k`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list. This will allow us to easily traverse the tree and find paths between vertices.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path between any two vertices is unique. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: For each vertex `k`, once we have the path from vertex 1 to `k`, we need to compute the LIS of the sequence of values on this path. We can use a dynamic programming approach with binary search to efficiently compute the LIS in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the path.

4. **Output**: For each vertex `k`, output the length of the LIS of the path from vertex 1 to `k`.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of vertices `N`, the list of values `a`, and the list of edges.
2. Construct the adjacency list for the tree.
3. Perform a BFS or DFS from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.
4. For each vertex `k`:
   - Retrieve the path from vertex 1 to `k`.
   - Extract the sequence of values on this path.
   - Compute the LIS of this sequence using a dynamic programming approach with binary search.
   - Store the length of the LIS.
5. Print the LIS lengths for each vertex from 1 to `N`.

[/Environment Feedback]

INFO - [Task id] 513 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 513 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the input will not be processed, and no output will be generated. This is likely the reason for the "No output detected" error.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to be run directly, the function should be called at the end of the script to ensure it executes.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format in the feedback seems to be a list of strings, but the code prints integers directly. This discrepancy might be due to the testing environment's expectations, but typically, the output should be printed as integers, one per line.

4. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for finding the LIS and the BFS traversal to find paths seems correct. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify this.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called at the end of the script to trigger the input reading and processing.

2. **Verify Output**: Ensure that the output is printed correctly, one integer per line, as expected by the problem statement.

3. **Test the Code**: After making these changes, test the code with the provided sample input to ensure it produces the correct output.

### Revised Code

Let's make these changes and provide the revised code:

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 513 [generation text] In this problem, we were tasked with finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for paths in a tree structure. The core concepts involved were tree traversal, pathfinding, and dynamic programming for LIS calculation.

### Key Concepts and Strategies:
1. **Tree Representation**: We used an adjacency list to represent the tree, which is efficient for traversal operations like BFS or DFS.

2. **Pathfinding in Trees**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path between any two nodes is unique. We used BFS starting from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: We employed a dynamic programming approach with binary search to compute the LIS efficiently in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the path.

### Challenges and Solutions:
- **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not called, leading to no output. Ensuring the `solve()` function was called resolved this issue.
- **Output Format**: The problem required outputting the LIS length for each vertex path, which was correctly handled by printing each result on a new line.

### Code Snippet:
```python
def find_lis_length(sequence):
    lis = []
    for value in sequence:
        low, high = 0, len(lis)
        while low < high:

        if low == len(lis):
            lis.append(value)
        else:
            lis[low] = value
    return len(lis)

The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
We have a tree with N vertices, whose i-th edge connects Vertex u_i and Vertex v_i.
Vertex i has an integer a_i written on it.
For every integer k from 1 through N, solve the following problem:
 - We will make a sequence by lining up the integers written on the vertices along the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex k, in the order they appear. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence of this sequence.
Here, the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence A of length L is the subsequence A_{i_1} , A_{i_2} , ... , A_{i_M} with the greatest possible value of M such that 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_M \leq L and A_{i_1} < A_{i_2} < ... < A_{i_M}.

-----Constraints-----
 - 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq u_i , v_i \leq N
 - u_i \neq v_i
 - The given graph is a tree.
 - All values in input are integers.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N
u_1 v_1
u_2 v_2
:
u_{N-1} v_{N-1}

-----Output-----
Print N lines. The k-th line, print the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the sequence obtained from the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex k.

-----Sample Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 513 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a tree with `N` vertices, where each vertex has an integer value associated with it. The tree is defined by `N-1` edges connecting these vertices. For each vertex `k` from 1 to `N`, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the sequence formed by the values on the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex `k`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list. This will allow us to easily traverse the tree and find paths between vertices.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path between any two vertices is unique. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.

3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: For each vertex `k`, once we have the path from vertex 1 to `k`, we need to compute the LIS of the sequence of values on this path. We can use a dynamic programming approach with binary search to efficiently compute the LIS in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the path.

4. **Output**: For each vertex `k`, output the length of the LIS of the path from vertex 1 to `k`.

### Pseudocode

1. Parse the input to get the number of vertices `N`, the list of values `a`, and the list of edges.
2. Construct the adjacency list for the tree.
3. Perform a BFS or DFS from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.
4. For each vertex `k`:
   - Retrieve the path from vertex 1 to `k`.
   - Extract the sequence of values on this path.
   - Compute the LIS of this sequence using a dynamic programming approach with binary search.
   - Store the length of the LIS.
5. Print the LIS lengths for each vertex from 1 to `N`.

### Python Code

    if not sequence:
        return 0

        # Binary search to find the position to replace or extend the LIS
        low, high = 0, len(lis)

    # Print results

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 513 [prompt] Let's analyze the code and identify potential issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The code uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the input will not be processed, and no output will be generated. This is likely the reason for the "No output detected" error.

2. **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is defined but not called. In a script intended to be run directly, the function should be called at the end of the script to ensure it executes.

3. **Output Format**: The expected output format in the feedback seems to be a list of strings, but the code prints integers directly. This discrepancy might be due to the testing environment's expectations, but typically, the output should be printed as integers, one per line.

4. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic for finding the LIS and the BFS traversal to find paths seems correct. However, without executing the function, we cannot verify this.

### Steps to Fix

1. **Call the `solve()` Function**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called at the end of the script to trigger the input reading and processing.

2. **Verify Output**: Ensure that the output is printed correctly, one integer per line, as expected by the problem statement.

3. **Test the Code**: After making these changes, test the code with the provided sample input to ensure it produces the correct output.

- **Output**: The results are printed as integers, one per line, which matches the expected output format for the problem. 

This should resolve the issue of no output being detected and ensure the solution is executed correctly.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 513 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Process

This problem involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for paths in a tree, which is a non-trivial task due to the constraints and the need for efficient computation. Here are some insights and reflections based on the problem-solving process and the official solution:

1. **Tree Traversal**: Both my solution and the official solution use tree traversal to explore paths from the root to each node. I used BFS to find paths, while the official solution uses DFS. DFS is more natural for recursive exploration and can be more memory efficient due to its stack-based nature.

2. **LIS Calculation**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming approach with binary search to maintain the LIS efficiently. This is a well-known technique that allows LIS computation in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the sequence. My solution also used this approach, which is optimal for the problem constraints.

3. **State Management**: The official solution uses a clever technique to manage state changes during DFS. It maintains a list of changes (`changes`) to backtrack the state of the `dp` array after exploring each subtree. This ensures that the LIS calculation is correct for each path without affecting other paths. This is a key insight that ensures correctness when using DFS.

4. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution sets a high recursion limit (`sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)`) to handle deep recursion in large trees. This is an important consideration for problems involving deep recursive calls.

5. **Efficiency and Correctness**: The official solution is efficient and correct, leveraging the properties of trees and the LIS algorithm effectively. It handles the problem constraints well and provides a robust solution.

### Key Takeaways

- **DFS with State Management**: Using DFS with careful state management (like the `changes` list) can be very effective in tree problems where paths need to be explored independently.
- **LIS with Binary Search**: The combination of dynamic programming and binary search for LIS is a powerful technique for sequence problems, especially under tight constraints.
- **Recursion Limits**: Be mindful of recursion limits in Python when dealing with deep recursive calls, especially in large trees.

Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of efficient algorithms and careful state management in complex data structures like trees.

    We have a tree with N vertices, whose i-th edge connects Vertex u_i and Vertex v_i.
    Vertex i has an integer a_i written on it.
    For every integer k from 1 through N, solve the following problem:
     - We will make a sequence by lining up the integers written on the vertices along the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex k, in the order they appear. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence of this sequence.
    Here, the longest increasing subsequence of a sequence A of length L is the subsequence A_{i_1} , A_{i_2} , ... , A_{i_M} with the greatest possible value of M such that 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_M \leq L and A_{i_1} < A_{i_2} < ... < A_{i_M}.

     - u_i \neq v_i
     - The given graph is a tree.
     - All values in input are integers.
