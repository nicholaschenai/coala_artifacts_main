    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a tree with `N` vertices, where each vertex has an integer value associated with it. The tree is defined by `N-1` edges connecting these vertices. For each vertex `k` from 1 to `N`, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the sequence formed by the values on the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex `k`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list. This will allow us to easily traverse the tree and find paths between vertices.\n\n2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path between any two vertices is unique. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.\n\n3. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**: For each vertex `k`, once we have the path from vertex 1 to `k`, we need to compute the LIS of the sequence of values on this path. We can use a dynamic programming approach with binary search to efficiently compute the LIS in `O(L log L)` time, where `L` is the length of the path.\n\n4. **Output**: For each vertex `k`, output the length of the LIS of the path from vertex 1 to `k`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Parse the input to get the number of vertices `N`, the list of values `a`, and the list of edges.\n2. Construct the adjacency list for the tree.\n3. Perform a BFS or DFS from vertex 1 to find paths to all other vertices.\n4. For each vertex `k`:\n   - Retrieve the path from vertex 1 to `k`.\n   - Extract the sequence of values on this path.\n   - Compute the LIS of this sequence using a dynamic programming approach with binary search.\n   - Store the length of the LIS.\n5. Print the LIS lengths for each vertex from 1 to `N`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_lis_length(sequence):\n    if not sequence:\n        return 0\n    \n    # This will store the smallest ending value of an increasing subsequence of each length\n    lis = []\n    \n    for value in sequence:\n        # Binary search to find the position to replace or extend the LIS\n        low, high = 0, len(lis)\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if lis[mid] < value:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        # If low is equal to the length of lis, it means we are extending the LIS\n        if low == len(lis):\n            lis.append(value)\n        else:\n            lis[low] = value\n    \n    return len(lis)\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:N+1]))\n    edges = list(zip(map(int, data[N+1::2]), map(int, data[N+2::2])))\n    \n    from collections import defaultdict, deque\n    \n    # Build the adjacency list for the tree\n    tree = defaultdict(list)\n    for u, v in edges:\n        tree[u].append(v)\n        tree[v].append(u)\n    \n    # BFS to find paths from vertex 1 to all other vertices\n    parent = {1: None}\n    queue = deque([1])\n    paths = {1: [1]}\n    \n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        for neighbor in tree[node]:\n            if neighbor not in parent:\n                parent[neighbor] = node\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n                paths[neighbor] = paths[node] + [neighbor]\n    \n    # Calculate LIS for each path from 1 to k\n    results = []\n    for k in range(1, N + 1):\n        path = paths[k]\n        sequence = [a[i - 1] for i in path]  # Convert 1-based index to 0-based\n        lis_length = find_lis_length(sequence)\n        results.append(lis_length)\n    \n    # Print results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```\n\nThis code efficiently computes the LIS for each path from vertex 1 to every other vertex in the tree, using BFS to determine paths and a dynamic programming approach with binary search to compute the LIS.",
