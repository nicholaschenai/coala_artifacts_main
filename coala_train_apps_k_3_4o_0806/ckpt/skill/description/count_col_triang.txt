[description for function: count_col_triang]
The function takes a list of points, each associated with a color, and calculates the total number of points, the number of distinct colors, and the total number of non-collinear triangles that can be formed using points of the same color. It groups the points by their color and checks all combinations of three points within each color group to determine if they form a triangle. It keeps track of the maximum number of triangles formed by any single color and identifies which color(s) achieve this maximum. The function returns a list containing the total number of points, the number of colors, the total number of triangles, and a sorted list of colors that form the maximum number of triangles, followed by the count of these triangles. If no triangles are formed, it returns an empty list for colors.

This knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze geometric properties of points on a plane, particularly when dealing with problems involving collinearity and triangle formation. It is applicable in computational geometry, computer graphics, and spatial data analysis where determining the number of possible triangles from a set of points is required. This can be useful in applications such as geographic information systems (GIS), computer-aided design (CAD), and any field that requires spatial reasoning or pattern recognition. The method of checking collinearity using determinants is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and can be applied to various problems involving alignment and geometric configurations.
